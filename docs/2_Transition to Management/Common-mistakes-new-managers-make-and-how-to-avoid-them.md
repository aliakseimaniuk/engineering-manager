# Common Mistakes New Managers Make (and How to Avoid Them)

Stepping into management is a significant transition. Engineers are often rewarded for independent problem-solving; management requires a shift in focus – from *doing* the work to enabling others to do their best work. This article outlines common pitfalls for new engineering managers and offers practical advice for success.

The most impactful work a manager does often happens *behind the scenes* – the mentorship, the relationship building, the proactive planning. It’s easy to get caught up in technical details and deadlines, but prioritizing these “invisible” tasks is what truly drives high-performing teams.

### Mistake #1: Trying to Do It All

It’s tempting to jump in and solve every problem yourself, especially when you’re an experienced engineer. However, this creates a bottleneck, prevents your team from growing, and will quickly lead to burnout – for you *and* them. 

**Why it happens:** A natural desire to apply your technical expertise and deliver results. It feels faster to just *do* it yourself than to explain it to someone else.

**How to avoid it:**  Embrace the role of a facilitator, not a firefighter.  Delegate tasks, provide guidance, and trust your team to deliver. Remember, your job is to unlock *their* potential, not to be the sole contributor. Think of yourself as a multiplier – amplifying the impact of your team, rather than a doer simply completing tasks. 

### Mistake #2: Neglecting 1:1s

Regular one-on-one meetings are crucial for building trust, providing feedback, and understanding your team’s challenges. Too often, they get cancelled due to urgent tasks or simply fall by the wayside.

**Why it happens:**  A busy schedule and a perceived lack of time. It's easy to prioritize immediate tasks over longer-term relationship building.

**How to avoid it:**  Schedule recurring 1:1s and treat them as sacred. Come prepared with an agenda – even a simple list of topics ensures a focused conversation.  Practice active listening, offering support and guidance. Aim for a 70/30 split – letting your team drive the conversation 70% of the time and offering your input the remaining 30%. End each meeting with clear action items and follow-up steps.

### Mistake #3: Underestimating Mentorship & Onboarding

New team members, and even experienced ones taking on new roles, need guidance and support. Underinvesting in onboarding and mentorship can lead to decreased productivity, frustration, and ultimately, employee turnover.

**Why it happens:** A focus on immediate deliverables and a belief that technical skills are enough. 

**How to avoid it:**  Prioritize thorough onboarding – providing clear expectations, necessary resources, and opportunities for learning.  Pair new team members with mentors who can offer guidance, answer questions, and help them navigate the organization. Good onboarding reduces time to productivity and increases retention, providing a strong return on investment.

### Mistake #4: Being Reactive Instead of Proactive

It’s easy to get caught up in day-to-day fire drills, but effective managers anticipate problems and proactively address them.  Constantly reacting to issues leaves you feeling stressed, and prevents you from focusing on long-term goals.

**Why it happens:** A desire to immediately solve pressing problems and a lack of time for strategic planning.

**How to avoid it:**  Block off dedicated time each week for strategic planning and process improvement.  Actively solicit feedback from your team – through regular team retrospectives, anonymous surveys, or “skip-level” meetings. Ask: What’s working well? What could be improved? What are their biggest challenges?  Proactive problem-solving not only prevents crises but also creates a more positive and productive work environment.



### The Invisible Work is the Most Important Work

Stepping into management is a significant transition. It’s not about being the best engineer anymore; it’s about building a high-performing team and enabling them to do their best work.  

The mistakes outlined above aren't signs of failure; they’re learning opportunities. The key is to recognize them, adapt your approach, and prioritize the “invisible” work – the mentorship, the relationship building, the proactive planning – that truly drives success. 

It's a challenging journey, but incredibly rewarding. Take a moment to reflect on your own management style. What's one area you can focus on improving this week to better support your team?
