# Engineering vs. Product vs. TPM: Who Owns What in Execution?

In rapidly scaling tech companies, confusion over roles and responsibilities between Product, Engineering, and Technical Program Management can lead to wasted effort, delayed releases, and frustrated teams. Defining clear ownership is critical for maximizing efficiency and delivering value to customers.

This article will outline the core responsibilities of each role, highlighting the areas of collaboration and providing a framework for building high-performing teams.

## Product Management: Defining the "What" and "Why"

Product Management is responsible for understanding the customer, defining the product vision, and prioritizing features that deliver maximum value. Key responsibilities include:

* **Market Research:** Identifying customer needs and market opportunities.
* **Product Strategy:** Defining the long-term vision and roadmap for the product.
* **Prioritization:** Determining which features to build and in what order.
* **Requirements Gathering:** Translating customer needs into detailed specifications.
* **Communication:**  Sharing the product vision and roadmap with stakeholders.

## Engineering: Building the "How"

Engineering is responsible for taking the product requirements and turning them into a working product. Key responsibilities include:

* **Architecture & Design:** Designing the technical architecture of the product.
* **Development:** Writing and testing the code that powers the product.
* **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring the product meets quality standards.
* **Deployment & Maintenance:**  Releasing the product to customers and providing ongoing support.
* **Technical Feasibility:** Collaboratively assessing the technical challenges and potential solutions for proposed features. *This isn't simply telling Product what's hard, but a discussion about options and trade-offs.*

## Technical Program Management: Orchestrating the "When" and "Who"

Technical Program Management (TPM) is responsible for planning, coordinating, and executing complex projects. Key responsibilities include:

* **Program Planning:**  Creating detailed project plans with timelines, milestones, and dependencies.
* **Risk Management:**  Identifying and mitigating potential risks that could derail the project.
* **Cross-Functional Coordination:** Facilitating communication and collaboration between Product, Engineering, and other stakeholders. *TPMs don't just coordinate tasks; they proactively connect teams and ensure everyone is aligned.*
* **Progress Tracking & Reporting:** Monitoring progress against plan and providing regular updates to stakeholders.
* **Process Improvement:** Identifying opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the development process.

## The Role of the VP of Engineering: Balancing Sustainability and Delivery

The VP of Engineering plays a crucial role in balancing the demands of product innovation with the need for a sustainable and scalable engineering organization. They ensure the delivery of the products defined by Product, built by Engineering, and orchestrated by TPM, while also prioritizing long-term technical health.

* **Capacity Planning:** Ensuring the engineering organization has the resources and skills to meet current and future demands. *This directly impacts velocity, reduces technical debt, and boosts team morale.*
* **Technical Debt Management:** Prioritizing and addressing technical debt to maintain the long-term health of the codebase.
* **Team Health & Development:** Fostering a positive and productive engineering culture.
* **Process Optimization:** Continuously improving the engineering development process.



## Collaboration & Handling Friction

Even with clearly defined roles, friction can occur. When priorities clash, it's crucial to revisit the customer value and business goals to align on the best course of action. Open communication, active listening, and a willingness to compromise are essential for building a high-performing team.


By embracing clear ownership, fostering open communication, and prioritizing collaboration, organizations can build high-performing teams and consistently deliver value to their customers.
