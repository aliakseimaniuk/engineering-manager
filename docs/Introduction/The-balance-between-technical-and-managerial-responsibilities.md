# The Tightrope Walk: Balancing Technical & Managerial Responsibilities

Balancing technical expertise with managerial duties is a common struggle for new engineering managers. It's tempting to jump back into coding, fix that critical bug, or optimize that performance bottleneck yourself. But resisting that urge is crucial for growth—both yours and your team’s. This article explores how to navigate this tightrope walk, empowering you to lead effectively without losing touch with your technical roots.

## The Trap of “Just Fixing It”

The initial pull to revert to a “maker” mindset is strong. It *feels* faster to simply solve the problem yourself than to explain it to someone else, wait for them to fix it, or risk a less-than-optimal solution. This is especially true when deadlines loom. However, consistently “just fixing it” creates a bottleneck, stifles the growth of your team, and prevents you from focusing on higher-level strategic initiatives. It inadvertently communicates a lack of trust in your team’s abilities and hinders their development.

## Shifting Your Mental Model

The key to escaping this trap is to shift your mindset from individual contributor to *enabler*. Your primary responsibility is no longer to *do* the work, but to *ensure the work gets done effectively* by others. This requires a fundamental change in how you approach challenges. Instead of asking "How can I fix this?", start asking "How can I empower my team to fix this?". This subtle shift unlocks a powerful new approach to leadership.

## Strategies for Effective Balancing

Here’s how to translate that mindset into action:

### 1. Prioritize Unblocking, Not Fixing

Focus on removing obstacles that prevent your team from succeeding. This might involve clarifying requirements, coordinating with other teams, securing necessary resources, or streamlining processes. For example, proactively reaching out to the DevOps team to resolve a persistent CI/CD issue can have a far greater impact than fixing a bug in isolation.

### 2. Embrace Delegation

Learning to effectively delegate tasks – even if you can do them faster yourself – is crucial for your team’s growth and your own effectiveness. Delegation isn’t about offloading work; it’s about providing opportunities for team members to expand their skills and take ownership.

### 3. Master the Art of Asking Questions

Instead of jumping to solutions, ask clarifying questions to help your team think through the problem themselves. “What approaches have you considered?” “What are the potential trade-offs?” “What resources do you need to move forward?” This fosters critical thinking and empowers them to find their own solutions.

### 4. Strategic Technical Contribution 

While you should avoid falling back into full-time coding, completely abandoning technical work isn’t ideal. *Some* technical engagement is valuable for staying grounded, maintaining credibility, and understanding the challenges your team faces. This might involve reviewing critical code, contributing to architectural discussions, or prototyping innovative solutions.  However, this should be a deliberate and limited activity, strategically chosen to maximize impact and minimize disruption.

### 5. Prioritize Mentorship and Coaching

Investing in your team’s growth is one of the most effective ways to balance your responsibilities.  Effective mentorship activities include pair programming, conducting code reviews focused on learning and skill development, and providing guidance on design decisions. 



## The “Technical Budget” – Allocating Your Time

It's helpful to think of your time as a "technical budget." How you allocate that budget sends a powerful message about your priorities. A common breakdown looks like this:

*   **10% Technical Contribution:** Deliberate engagement in hands-on technical work.
*   **30% Strategic Initiatives:** Focusing on long-term planning, process improvement, and architectural decisions.
*   **60% People Management:**  This includes unblocking, delegation, mentorship, and fostering a positive team environment.

## Understanding Why Technical Depth Matters

Understanding the technical intricacies of your team’s work isn't just about staying sharp; it’s essential for effectively communicating with stakeholders and advocating for your team's needs.  When you understand *how* things work, you can accurately explain the impact of technical decisions, justify resource requests, and translate technical challenges into business terms. This ability to bridge the gap between engineering and other departments is a critical skill for any engineering leader.

## It’s a Continuous Calibration

Balancing technical and managerial responsibilities isn’t a one-time fix. It’s a continuous calibration. As your team grows and the project evolves, you’ll need to adjust your priorities and refine your approach. Be honest with yourself about where you’re spending your time, and seek feedback from your team to ensure you’re effectively balancing your responsibilities.

### Dealing with Resistance

Sometimes, team members may *expect* you to solve problems directly, especially if that’s been the pattern in the past. When this happens, gently guide them through the problem-solving process instead of immediately offering a solution. Ask questions, encourage them to explore different approaches, and provide support without taking over.

Finally, remember that leadership is a journey, not a destination.  Embrace the challenges, learn from your mistakes, and continuously strive to empower your team to achieve its full potential.
