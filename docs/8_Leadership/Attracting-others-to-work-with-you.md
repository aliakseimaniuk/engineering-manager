# Beyond the Perks: Attracting Top Talent by Being Someone People *Want* to Work With

Attracting and retaining top engineering talent is more challenging than ever. In today's competitive landscape, salary and traditional perks are no longer enough. Engineers are seeking more than just a job; they want to be part of a thriving, supportive culture where they feel valued and can grow. This article explores how focusing on leadership and creating a positive environment—being someone people *want* to work with—is crucial for building a high-performing team.

## The Shift from Recruiter to Ambassador

For years, I approached hiring as a recruiter – checking boxes, assessing skills, and focusing on filling a role. While important, this transactional approach missed a critical piece: building genuine connections and demonstrating a commitment to individual growth.  I realized that my role wasn't just to *find* talent, but to *attract* it by showcasing a compelling vision and fostering a culture people genuinely wanted to be a part of.  This shift meant actively highlighting our team's values, demonstrating empathy, and prioritizing individual development. I started spending more time in one-on-ones understanding career aspirations, and less time solely focused on task assignments.  The results were significant—a noticeable increase in candidate engagement and a more loyal, motivated team. 

## Building Trust Through Consistent Action

To attract and retain top engineers, you need to actively invest in building a culture of trust and respect. This isn’t about grand gestures; it’s about consistent, everyday actions that demonstrate you value your team. Here’s how:

**Investing in Your Team:**  Truly great engineers want to learn and grow. Provide opportunities for professional development—whether it's sponsoring conference attendance, online courses, or internal training sessions.  I’ve found that allocating dedicated “learning time” each week—even just a few hours—shows a tangible commitment to their development.  More importantly, actively *discuss* their career goals during one-on-ones and help them identify opportunities to achieve them. 

**Practicing Radical Transparency:**  Engineers value honesty and open communication.  Be transparent about company goals, challenges, and decisions whenever possible. This doesn't mean sharing confidential information, but rather explaining *why* decisions are made and keeping the team informed. For example, during a recent project delay, we held an all-hands meeting to explain the reasons (supply chain issues), the impact on timelines, and the steps we were taking to mitigate the situation. While not ideal, the team appreciated the honesty and felt more involved in finding solutions.

**Demonstrating Active Listening and Follow-Through:**  In a fast-paced engineering environment, it's easy to fall into the trap of simply “checking the box” during one-on-ones.  True active listening means giving your full attention, asking clarifying questions, and summarizing what you've heard to ensure understanding.  More importantly, it means *acting* on feedback whenever possible.  If someone suggests a process improvement, even if it's small, acknowledge it and either implement it or explain why it’s not feasible.  We implemented a “suggestion box” (a dedicated Slack channel) where engineers could share ideas, and I personally committed to reviewing and responding to each one within 48 hours.

**Embracing Vulnerability:** Leaders aren't expected to have all the answers.  In fact, admitting mistakes and seeking input from the team can build trust and foster a more collaborative environment.  I once made a technical miscalculation that led to a minor setback on a project. Instead of trying to cover it up, I openly admitted my error to the team and asked for their help in finding a solution.  Not only did they quickly identify a fix, but they also expressed appreciation for my honesty.



## Onboarding for Connection

Creating a positive environment doesn't stop at hiring. The onboarding process is critical for reinforcing these values.  Don't just focus on technical training; make a conscious effort to integrate new hires into the team and company culture.  

We shifted our onboarding program to include “buddy” assignments, where new hires are paired with experienced engineers who can provide mentorship and support. More importantly, we involve new hires in team exercises *from day one*, even if it's just a casual brainstorming session. This isn't just beneficial for them; it also encourages existing team members to reflect on their own practices and share their knowledge.  



## Why This Matters: Building a High-Performing Team

The traditional approach to attracting talent—focusing solely on salary and perks—is no longer sufficient.  Engineers are looking for more than just a job; they want to be part of a culture where they feel valued, challenged, and supported. By prioritizing leadership, building trust, and investing in your team, you can create an environment where top engineers thrive—and where your company can achieve its full potential. 



## Putting It into Action:  A Quick Checklist

*   **Prioritize One-on-Ones:**  Make dedicated time for individual check-ins with your team members.
*   **Embrace Transparency:**  Communicate openly about company goals, challenges, and decisions.
*   **Encourage Growth:** Provide opportunities for professional development.
*   **Actively Listen:**  Give your full attention and respond to feedback.
*   **Foster Collaboration:**  Encourage teamwork and knowledge sharing.



By consistently implementing these principles, you'll not only attract top engineering talent but also build a high-performing, engaged, and loyal team.
