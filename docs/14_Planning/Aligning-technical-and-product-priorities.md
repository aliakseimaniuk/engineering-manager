# Aligning Technical and Product Priorities

This article is for engineering leaders who want to foster better collaboration and deliver impactful software. It addresses the common challenge of misalignment between technical and product priorities and proposes a system for building a more collaborative and effective team.

Software engineers want to build a product that is used and adds value. By actively fostering alignment between technical and product priorities, you can empower your team to deliver impactful software that drives business success. It’s not just about *building* things; it's about building the *right* things.

## The Challenge of Misalignment

Often, technical and product teams operate with different perspectives and priorities. Product teams focus on user needs, market demands, and business goals, while engineering teams concentrate on technical feasibility, scalability, and maintainability. While both are critical, a disconnect can lead to wasted effort, delayed launches, and ultimately, a less successful product. This misalignment isn’t about blame; it’s about different viewpoints. It’s a natural consequence of specialized roles, but one that requires proactive management.

## Building the Alignment System

Here’s a practical system to foster collaboration and ensure everyone is working towards the same goals:

**1. Establish Shared Understanding:**

Before diving into development, ensure both teams have a clear and common understanding of the product vision, target audience, and key business objectives. This involves regular cross-functional meetings, shared documentation, and open communication channels.

**2. “Why” Before “How”:**

Don't jump into solutions before fully understanding the *problem*. Encourage product teams to articulate the "why" behind each feature request.  As a leader, you can champion this by asking probing questions like:

*   “What user problem are we solving with this feature?”
*   “How will this feature impact our key business metrics?”
*   “What are the desired outcomes for our users?”

This ensures the engineering team understands the value they're delivering and can propose the most effective solutions.

**3. Regular ‘Tech Deep Dives’:**

Dedicate time for product teams to learn about the technical constraints and opportunities. These "Tech Deep Dives" shouldn’t be just technical jargon; explain concepts in a way that a non-technical audience can understand. Cover topics like:

*   Current system architecture and limitations
*   Potential scalability challenges
*   Estimated effort for different approaches
*   Trade-offs between speed, quality, and cost. 

A good format is a presentation followed by an open Q&A session, allowing product teams to ask questions and gain a deeper understanding of the technical landscape.

**4. Empower Engineers as Problem Solvers:**

Involve engineers early in the problem definition process. Don’t just hand them requirements; ask for their input.  For example, at one company, an engineer identified a more efficient solution to a feature request by questioning the initial assumptions, ultimately saving the team weeks of development time.

**5. Continuous Improvement & Feedback Loops:**

Software complexity increases, requirements change, and businesses evolve. You need to continuously monitor, evaluate, and adjust your approach. Regularly scheduled “post-mortems” after significant releases are invaluable. What went well? What could we have done better? What lessons can we apply to future projects?  These sessions provide a safe space for honest feedback and continuous improvement.

**6. Measure Success:**

How can you know if your alignment efforts are working? Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

*   **Reduced rework:** A decrease in the number of features that need to be re-engineered due to miscommunication or changing requirements.
*   **Faster time to market:** A quicker release cycle for new features and products.
*   **Increased customer satisfaction:** Positive feedback from users about the product and its features.
*    **Improved Team Morale**: Track team satisfaction through regular surveys to identify areas where alignment efforts are having a positive impact.



## Addressing Potential Pushback

Implementing this system might face resistance. Product teams might feel engineers are slowing down the process by asking too many questions. Engineering teams might feel product teams don’t appreciate the technical complexities involved. 

As a leader, you must proactively address these concerns:

*   **Communication is Key:** Clearly articulate the benefits of alignment to both teams.
*   **Lead by Example:** Demonstrate a willingness to listen to different perspectives and collaborate on solutions.
*   **Facilitate Open Dialogue:** Create a safe space for teams to express their concerns and challenges.



## The Right Things, Consistently

It’s not just about building the *right* things; it’s about consistently building *valuable* things. By actively fostering alignment between technical and product priorities, you empower your team to deliver impactful software that drives business success. A product vision shared by the whole team will lead to a much more efficient and collaborative development process, and ultimately deliver a better product.
