# Beyond the Paperwork: A Manager’s Checklist for a New Hire’s First Week

This article provides a practical checklist for engineering managers to create a welcoming and productive onboarding experience for new hires. By going beyond the administrative tasks, you can set your team members up for success and foster long-term engagement.

## The First Impressions Matter

The first week is critical. It sets the tone for the employee's entire tenure. A well-structured onboarding process reduces anxiety, accelerates productivity, and increases retention. This checklist focuses on creating a supportive environment where new hires can quickly integrate and contribute.

## Before Day One: Preparation is Key

*   **Account Setup:** Ensure all necessary accounts (email, Slack, project management tools, code repositories) are created and access is granted.
*   **Workspace Ready:** Whether in-office or remote, prepare the workspace. For in-office, ensure a clean desk and working equipment. For remote, confirm software is installed and configured.
*   **Welcome Communication:** Send a welcome email outlining what to expect on the first day, including schedule, dress code (if applicable), and point of contact.
*   **Buddy Assignment:** Pair the new hire with a "buddy" – a peer who can answer questions, provide guidance, and help them navigate the company culture.

## Day One: Welcome and Orientation

*   **Warm Welcome:** Greet the new hire personally and make them feel comfortable. A simple “welcome” goes a long way.
*   **Company Overview:** Provide a high-level overview of the company’s mission, values, and goals.
*   **Team Introductions:** Facilitate introductions to the team members, explaining their roles and responsibilities.
*   **HR Essentials:** Review essential HR policies and procedures (benefits, time off, expenses).
*   **Initial 1:1 Meeting:** Schedule a dedicated 1:1 meeting to discuss expectations, goals, and answer any immediate questions.  Ask: "What are your initial impressions, and what are you most excited about?"

## Days 2-5: Immersion and Integration

This is where the new hire begins to dive into the technical aspects of their role. 

*   **Technical Deep Dive:** Provide an overview of the project(s) they’ll be working on, the technology stack, and the development process.
*   **Codebase Familiarization:**  Grant access to code repositories and provide guidance on navigating the codebase. Encourage exploration and questions.
*   **Build Environment Setup:** Help them set up their local development environment.
*   **Internal Documentation:** Introduce them to essential internal documentation, wikis, and knowledge bases.
*   **Pairing with Senior Engineers:**  Encourage pairing with senior engineers for mentorship and guidance.  This is particularly helpful for navigating complex systems.
*   **Code/Design Reviews:** Involve them in code/design reviews – even if they’re not contributing code directly. This helps them understand the codebase, architectural decisions, and the team’s coding style. Encourage them to ask questions and offer perspectives, even as an observer.
*   **Small, Achievable Tasks:** Assign small, achievable tasks to build confidence and allow them to make early contributions.
*   **Regular Check-Ins:** Schedule daily or bi-daily check-ins to address questions, provide feedback, and ensure they’re on track. Ask: "What are your biggest priorities this week?" and "What roadblocks are you facing?" Be mindful of information overload. Break down tasks and concepts into manageable chunks, and provide resources for further learning.
*   **Team Lunches/Social Activities:** Encourage team lunches or social activities to foster camaraderie and build relationships.



## Addressing Remote/Hybrid Onboarding

For remote or hybrid teams, prioritize virtual "water cooler" chats, utilize video conferencing for introductions, and ensure clear communication channels. Schedule regular virtual coffee breaks or team lunches to replicate the in-person social interaction. When assigning tasks, be extra diligent in providing clear instructions and documentation.



## Common Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Overwhelming with Information:** Resist the urge to bombard the new hire with too much information at once. Prioritize essential information and provide resources for further learning.
*   **Lack of Clear Expectations:** Ensure the new hire understands their roles, responsibilities, and performance expectations.
*   **Neglecting Social Integration:** Don't underestimate the importance of social integration. Encourage team interaction and provide opportunities for building relationships.
*   **Ignoring Feedback:** Actively solicit feedback from the new hire and address any concerns promptly.




## The First Week Schedule: A Sample Outline

Here’s a possible outline for the first week, recognizing that specifics will vary by role and company:

*   **Day 1:** Welcome, Company Overview, Team Introductions, HR Essentials, 1:1 Meeting
*   **Day 2:** Technical Deep Dive, Access Setup, Initial Documentation Review, Buddy Meeting.
*   **Day 3:** Project Introduction, Codebase Exploration, Small Task Assignment, Daily Check-in.
*   **Day 4:**  Pairing Session, Code Review Participation, Documentation Contribution.
*   **Day 5:**  Project Update, 1:1 Feedback Session, Goal Setting for the Following Week.



## Beyond the First Week

Onboarding is an ongoing process. Continue to provide support, feedback, and opportunities for growth to ensure the new hire thrives in their role. Regular 1:1 meetings, performance reviews, and professional development opportunities are essential for long-term success.



By investing in a well-structured onboarding program, you can create a positive employee experience, increase productivity, and build a strong, engaged team.
