# Conducting effective first 1-on-1 meetings

## Making Those First 1-on-1s Count

Onboarding new team members effectively is crucial for their success – and the success of your team. Studies show that employees who experience effective onboarding are 69% more likely to stay with a company for three years. Conversely, poor onboarding can lead to decreased productivity, disengagement, and ultimately, increased turnover.  Investing time in building strong relationships from the start isn’t just good practice; it’s a strategic imperative. This article provides a framework for making those critical first 1-on-1 meetings truly count.

**Why Focus on the First 1-on-1?**

The first 1-on-1 sets the tone for the entire working relationship. It's an opportunity to build trust, clarify expectations, and empower your new hire to thrive. It's about more than just covering logistics; it's about making them feel welcome, valued, and supported.

## Structuring Your First Meeting

Here’s a suggested structure for a productive and engaging first 1-on-1:

*   **Warm Welcome (5-10 minutes):** Start with a genuine welcome and express your excitement about having them on the team. Break the ice with casual conversation to help them feel comfortable.
*   **Their Story (15-20 minutes):** Dive deeper into understanding their background, experience, and aspirations.
*   **Role Clarification (10-15 minutes):** Ensure they have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, expectations, and how their role contributes to the team’s goals.
*   **Action Items & Next Steps (5-10 minutes):**  Collaboratively define clear next steps and action items to help them get up to speed.

## Diving Deeper: Key Conversation Points

Here's a breakdown of essential questions to cover in each section:

**1. Their Story:**

*   “Tell me about your background and what led you to this role.”
*   “What are you most excited about learning or accomplishing in this position?”
*   “What are your preferred ways of receiving feedback? Understanding how you best receive feedback will help me support your growth more effectively."
*   “What are you passionate about outside of work? Feel free to share as much or as little as you’re comfortable with.”
*   **Important:** It's crucial that you create a safe space for honesty and vulnerability.  Let them know they can be open about challenges they're facing.

**2. Role Clarification:**

*   “Let’s discuss your key responsibilities and how they align with the team’s goals.”
*   “What are your initial priorities for the first 30/60/90 days?”
*   “How does this role fit into the bigger picture of the company and the team? And who are the key people you’ll be collaborating with?"
*   **Consider setting initial, achievable goals:** Even small wins early on can boost confidence and motivation.

**3. Action Items & Next Steps:**

*   “What’s one thing *you* plan to tackle in the next week to get up to speed?”
*   “What support do you need from me or the team to be successful?”
*   “Let's schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss your progress and address any challenges.”
*   Document action items and next steps to ensure accountability.

## Beyond the First Meeting: Consistency is Key

The first 1-on-1 is just the beginning. Maintaining regular check-ins is crucial for ongoing support and development.

*   **Cadence:** Aim for weekly or bi-weekly 1-on-1s, adjusting the frequency based on their progress and comfort level.
*   **Agenda Ownership:** Encourage them to take ownership of the agenda. Send a template in advance and encourage them to add items they want to discuss.
*   **Follow-up:**  Consistently document action items and progress in a shared document or system to ensure accountability and track growth.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*   **Talking *at* them instead of *with* them:**  Make it a two-way conversation.
*   **Focusing solely on tasks and deliverables:**  Remember to address their individual needs and aspirations.
*   **Not actively listening:**  Pay attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues.
*   **Failing to follow up on action items:**  Consistency is key to building trust and demonstrating support.



A well-executed first 1-on-1 isn’t just good onboarding; it’s a powerful investment in your team’s success. By prioritizing connection, clarity, and consistent support, you can set your new hires up to thrive and unlock their full potential.
