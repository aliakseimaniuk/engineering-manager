# Onboarding: Setting Expectations and Defining Success Early

Studies show that companies with a structured onboarding process experience up to 50% higher new hire retention. In today’s competitive engineering landscape, a strong onboarding experience isn’t just about paperwork and introductions – it’s a critical investment in your team’s success. This article provides actionable advice for engineering leaders on how to set clear expectations and empower new hires to thrive.

## The Cost of Poor Onboarding

Too often, new engineers are thrown into projects without a clear understanding of priorities, quality standards, or even where to find essential resources. This can lead to frustration, delays, and ultimately, decreased productivity. A well-defined onboarding process mitigates these risks, fostering engagement and accelerating time to contribution.

## A Multi-Layered Approach to Setting Expectations

Effective onboarding isn't a single event; it's a series of deliberate steps designed to integrate new hires into the team and company culture. Here’s a breakdown of how to approach it:

### 1. The 30-60-90 Day Plan: A Foundation for Success

The 30-60-90 day plan is a classic for a reason. It provides a structured framework for setting goals and tracking progress. But simply having a plan isn't enough. The key is *specificity*. Instead of vague objectives like "learn the codebase," define concrete deliverables:

*   **30 Days:**  “Complete tutorial X and contribute a small bug fix to module Y.”
*   **60 Days:** “Independently implement feature Z, adhering to established coding standards.”
*   **90 Days:** “Take ownership of component A, including bug fixing, feature development, and documentation.”

### 2. Project-Specific Expectations: Defining “Done” and Quality

Don’t just tell new hires *what* to build; define *how* it should be built. Incorporate these elements into project tasks:

*   **Acceptance Criteria:** Clearly outline the conditions that must be met for a task to be considered complete.
*   **Definition of Done (DoD):** Establish a consistent standard for quality, including code review, testing, documentation, and adherence to coding standards. 
*   **Quality Metrics:**  Where applicable, define measurable quality attributes (e.g., code coverage, performance benchmarks).

### 3. Regular 1:1s:  Communication and Support

Consistent one-on-one meetings are crucial for providing guidance, addressing concerns, and building rapport. Here are some questions to focus on:

*   “What are your biggest challenges right now?”
*   “Are there any resources you need that you haven't been provided?”
*   “How confident are you in your understanding of the project goals?”
*   "What can I do to help you be more successful?"

This is also an opportunity to proactively identify and fill any gaps in their understanding.

## Addressing the Unique Challenges of Remote/Hybrid Onboarding

With increasingly distributed teams, onboarding must adapt. Here's how to ensure a seamless experience for remote and hybrid engineers:

*   **Documentation is Key:**  Over-document everything – processes, tools, coding standards, and FAQs.
*   **Virtual Team Building:**  Facilitate virtual social events and encourage informal communication channels.
*   **Dedicated Mentorship:** Pair new hires with experienced engineers who can provide guidance and support remotely.
*   **Increased Check-Ins:**  Schedule more frequent 1:1s to address questions and concerns promptly.



## Proactive Support: Filling the Gaps Before They Emerge

Anticipate the needs of your new hires. What information or resources will they likely require?  

*   **Create a “New Hire Cheat Sheet.”** This can include links to documentation, frequently asked questions, contact information for key team members, and instructions for setting up their development environment. (See example below)
*   **Be Approachable:** Let them know that you're available to answer any questions, no matter how small. Foster a culture where asking for help is encouraged.

**Example: New Hire Cheat Sheet (Excerpt)**

|  Documentation Hub | [Link to Internal Wiki] | Comprehensive documentation on projects, tools, and processes |

## Connecting to Broader Company Goals

It’s not enough to simply assign tasks. Help new hires understand *how* their work contributes to the overall business objectives.

*   **Align with OKRs:** Use Objectives and Key Results to connect individual goals with company-wide priorities. 
*   **Provide Context:** Explain the "why" behind projects and features.  Help them understand how their work impacts users and the bottom line.




Ultimately, effective onboarding is an investment in your team’s future. By setting clear expectations, providing proactive support, and connecting individual contributions to the bigger picture, you can empower new engineers to thrive and contribute their best work.
