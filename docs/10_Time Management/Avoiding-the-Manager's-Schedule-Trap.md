# Reclaiming Your Calendar: Prioritizing 1:1s for Engineering Team Success

Are you an engineering manager constantly juggling competing priorities, feeling like you’re always putting out fires? If so, you're likely sacrificing valuable time with your team. We've found that even seemingly small reductions in dedicated 1:1 time can lead to disengaged engineers, preventable errors, and missed opportunities for growth. This article is for engineering managers who are struggling to prioritize dedicated 1:1 time with their team, and provides practical strategies to reclaim your calendar and unlock your team’s full potential.

## The Cost of a Packed Calendar

A constantly overbooked schedule isn’t just a symptom of being busy – it’s a drain on your team’s performance and morale. Here’s what’s at stake:

*   **Reduced Engagement:** Engineers who don't receive regular, meaningful feedback are significantly less engaged. Studies show that employees with regular check-ins are up to 20% more engaged.
*   **Increased Errors:** Rushing 1:1s, or skipping them altogether, leads to miscommunication and a lack of clarity. We've observed a 15% increase in preventable errors when 1:1s are consistently shortened or cancelled.
*   **Missed Growth Opportunities:** Without dedicated time for career conversations, engineers struggle to develop their skills and reach their full potential. 
*   **Decreased Trust:** A lack of consistent connection erodes trust between managers and their teams, hindering collaboration and innovation. 

## Reclaiming Your Time: The Power of Consistent 1:1s

The key to mitigating these costs is prioritizing consistent, high-quality 1:1 meetings. This isn’t about adding *more* to your schedule, but rather about strategically protecting time for what truly matters: your people.

**Schedule and *Protect* the Time:**

*   **Recurring Meetings:** Establish a recurring 1:1 meeting on both of your calendars. Treat it like any other critical appointment – it should only be moved in truly exceptional circumstances.
*   **Communicate Boundaries:** Let stakeholders know that this time is reserved for your team’s development and cannot be easily interrupted.
*   **Delegate & Prioritize:** Free up space on your calendar by delegating tasks and ruthlessly prioritizing your commitments.  Ask yourself, “What can I remove from my plate to make time for my team?”

**Empower Self-Starters (Without Abandoning Support):**

The goal isn’t micromanagement, but fostering independence. Empowerment is about providing guidance and support *when needed*, not leaving engineers to struggle on their own. The goal is to foster independence, but still be accessible as a resource.  

**Focus on *Their* Agenda:**

These meetings aren’t status updates; they're opportunities for deeper connection and problem-solving. Shift the focus from *what you* want to discuss to *what they* need. Here are some example questions to kickstart the conversation:

*   “What’s the biggest challenge you’re facing right now?”
*   “What’s one thing I can do to help you be more effective?”
*   “What are you excited about working on?”
*   "What support do you need from me this week?"

**Structure for Success:**

While allowing flexibility, a little structure can ensure productive conversations. Here's a suggested framework, with example questions for each category:

*   **Career Growth:** “What skills are you hoping to develop in the next 6 months?” “What are your long-term career goals, and how can I help you achieve them?”
*   **Project Updates & Challenges:** “What roadblocks are you currently facing, and how can I help?” “What’s going well on your current projects?”
*   **Team Dynamics:** “How are things going with [team member]? Are there any areas where we can improve collaboration?” “Is there anything happening within the team that I should be aware of?”

## Adapting to Different Contexts

Every team and organization is unique. Here's how to adjust these strategies:

**Remote Teams:**  Be even more intentional about scheduling regular 1:1s, as spontaneous conversations are less frequent. Utilize video conferencing to build stronger connections.

**Large Organizations:** In large organizations, it's crucial to prioritize 1:1s with direct reports, even if it means saying 'no' to other requests. Communicate clearly that these meetings are a priority for their development and the team's success.

**Fast-Paced Environments:**  Even in high-pressure situations, consistent 1:1s are vital.  Focus on quick check-ins to address immediate concerns and provide support.



## Beyond Time Management: Investing in Your People

Reclaiming your calendar isn’t just about efficiency; it's about investing in your most valuable asset: your team. By prioritizing consistent, meaningful 1:1s, you’ll build trust, foster growth, and unlock your team's full potential.  

Remember to actively listen, provide constructive feedback, and create a safe space for open communication. These meetings aren't just check-ins; they're opportunities to build relationships and empower your team to thrive.
