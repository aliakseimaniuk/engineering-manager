# Stop Doing Time, Start Managing It

Time is the most valuable resource for any engineering manager. Yet, it’s often spent reacting to urgent issues and firefighting problems, leaving little room for strategic thinking and proactive leadership. This article will help you move from a reactive to a proactive approach, enabling you to take control of your schedule and become a more effective leader.

## The Problem: Reactivity and Firefighting

As an engineering manager, you’re constantly bombarded with requests, interruptions, and unexpected issues. This constant stream of demands can lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed and a lack of control over your day.  Without a system for prioritizing and protecting your time, you’ll inevitably find yourself constantly *doing* time, rather than *managing* it.

## The Solution: Time Blocking

Time blocking is a time management method that involves scheduling specific blocks of time for specific tasks or activities. Instead of simply creating a to-do list, you allocate dedicated time slots in your calendar for everything, from strategic planning and 1:1 meetings to focused work and even email. This forces you to make conscious choices about how you spend your time and helps you prioritize what truly matters.

## How to Implement Time Blocking as an Engineering Manager

Here’s a step-by-step guide to implementing time blocking in your role:

**1. Identify Your Core Priorities:** Begin by identifying the most important areas of your responsibility. What activities directly contribute to your team's success and your long-term goals? Use frameworks like the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) or OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to help you prioritize.  

**2. Schedule Dedicated Blocks:**  Once you’ve identified your priorities, start scheduling dedicated time blocks in your calendar. Be realistic about how much time each task will take.  

**3. Protect Your Blocks:** This is the most crucial step.  Treat these blocks as non-negotiable appointments. Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and let your team know when you’re unavailable. 

**4. Review and Refine:**  Treat your time blocking system as an iterative process. Experiment with different approaches to find what works best for you.



## Sample Time Block Categories for Engineering Managers

Here are some categories to consider when scheduling your time blocks:

* **Strategic Planning:** Dedicate time to think long-term, anticipate challenges, and develop strategies for team success.
* **1:1 Meetings:** Regular 1:1s with team members are essential for coaching, feedback, and building relationships.
* **Team Meetings:** Schedule focused team meetings with clear agendas and action items.
* **Focused Work:**  Allocate time for tasks that require deep concentration, such as reviewing architecture diagrams, writing technical documentation, or researching new technologies.
* **Email & Communication:**  Batch email processing into specific time blocks, rather than responding to every message as it arrives.
* **Incident Response/Unplanned Work:**  Buffer in some time for handling urgent issues and unplanned tasks.

## Deep Dive: Maximizing Your 1:1s with Time Blocking

Effective 1:1s are crucial for engineering managers. Here’s how to leverage time blocking to get the most out of them:

* **Schedule Consistently:** Block out the same time each week or two for each 1:1.
* **Prepare in Advance:** Briefly review any previous action items or topics to ensure a productive conversation.
* **Focus on Development:** Use the time to coach and mentor your team members, rather than simply reviewing task updates.
* **Encourage Open Communication:** Create a safe space for your team members to share their thoughts, concerns, and ideas.




## Why Buffer Time Matters

Don't overschedule yourself.  Leave buffer time in your calendar to accommodate unexpected issues, urgent requests, and simply to recharge. This is essential for preventing burnout and maintaining a sustainable pace.

## Beyond Individual Blocks: Batching for Efficiency

Batching similar tasks together can significantly improve your productivity.  This minimizes context switching, which can significantly reduce cognitive load. Consider these examples:

* **Code Reviews:** Dedicate a block of time solely to reviewing code.
* **Documentation Updates:** Tackle all documentation tasks in one go.
* **Meeting Preparation:** Prepare for all upcoming meetings in a single session.
* **Email & Communication:** Process email and other communication channels in designated blocks.



## Real-World Example: From Overwhelmed to Proactive

Before implementing time blocking, I felt constantly overwhelmed by ad-hoc requests. Now, by protecting my strategic planning blocks, I’ve been able to proactively address potential roadblocks and improve team velocity. I’m less reactive and more focused on driving long-term success.

## Communicating Your System and Setting Expectations

Sharing your time-blocking system with your team is vital for buy-in. Explain the benefits – improved focus, more proactive leadership, and a better ability to support them.  It’s also essential to establish clear expectations about when you’re available and how to reach you in urgent situations. 




## Review and Refine

Time blocking isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Continuously evaluate your system and make adjustments as needed.  What’s working? What’s not?  Don't be afraid to experiment with different approaches to find what works best for you and your team.

## Conclusion: Taking Control of Your Time

Time blocking is a powerful tool for engineering managers who want to take control of their time, prioritize what matters, and become more effective leaders. By consciously allocating time for specific tasks and protecting those blocks from distractions, you can move from being reactive to proactive and achieve greater success in your role.
