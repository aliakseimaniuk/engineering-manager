# How to Protect Your Time Without Becoming Unavailable

As an engineering leader, it’s easy to get pulled in a million different directions. Constant requests, urgent issues, and a never-ending to-do list can quickly lead to burnout and hinder your ability to focus on strategic priorities. I recently spoke with a VP of Engineering who described his days as a constant fire drill – jumping from meeting to meeting, putting out fires, and never having time to think strategically. This is a common problem, and it's essential to learn how to protect your time without isolating yourself or appearing unapproachable. This article will provide practical strategies to help you regain control of your schedule and focus on what truly matters.

## Open Communication & Transparent Scheduling

One of the most effective ways to protect your time is to be open and transparent about your availability. Share your calendar with your team and clearly communicate when you’re available for meetings and focused work. This might seem counterintuitive – some leaders worry that being transparent will make them appear unapproachable. However, by clearly communicating your availability, you empower your team to self-serve and reduce unnecessary interruptions. Encourage your team to check your calendar *before* requesting a meeting and to group their questions together. This approach fosters trust and respect while allowing you to protect your focused time.

## Protecting Your Focus Time

Dedicated, uninterrupted time is essential for deep work and strategic thinking. Block out specific periods in your calendar for focused work and treat them as non-negotiable appointments. The “sacred lunch hour” analogy applies here – just as you wouldn’t cancel lunch with a key client, you shouldn’t cancel your focus time unless absolutely necessary. Consider setting an out-of-office message during your focus time to signal your availability and protect your deep work. This simple step can dramatically reduce distractions and allow you to make significant progress on critical tasks.

## Embracing Asynchronous Communication

While real-time communication is valuable, it's not always necessary. Encourage your team to embrace asynchronous communication methods like email, project management tools, and documentation. This allows individuals to work at their own pace and reduces the need for constant meetings.  Consider using tools like Loom for quick video updates – a good middle ground between real-time meetings and lengthy emails. When a quick question arises, encourage your team to message you asynchronously rather than immediately scheduling a meeting. This frees up valuable time and allows you to address issues more efficiently.

## Empowering Your Team Through Delegation

Delegation is a critical skill for any effective leader. Not only does it free up your time, but it also empowers your team and fosters their growth.  Instead of fixing the build error yourself, assign it to a junior engineer, offer guidance, and provide support. This demonstrates your trust in their abilities and allows them to develop new skills. Effective delegation isn’t about simply passing off tasks; it’s about providing the necessary context, resources, and support to ensure success. Building a self-sufficient, empowered team isn’t just about short-term productivity – it's about creating a lasting legacy and fostering the growth of your people.



By implementing these strategies, you can regain control of your time, reduce stress, and focus on the strategic priorities that drive success. Remember, protecting your time isn’t about being unapproachable; it’s about being a more effective leader and creating a sustainable work environment for yourself and your team.
