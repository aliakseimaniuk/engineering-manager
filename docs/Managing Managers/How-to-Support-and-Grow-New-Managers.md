# Supporting New Managers

Supporting new managers isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a strategic imperative. By investing in their growth, you’re investing in the future of your engineering organization. This article provides a framework for supporting new leaders, with a focus on practical advice and actionable steps.

## The Unique Challenges of the First-Time Manager

Transitioning from an individual contributor to a manager is a significant shift. While technical expertise is crucial for success as an IC, management demands a different skillset. Common struggles include letting go of individual tasks, learning to delegate effectively, navigating difficult conversations, the feeling of being less “productive” due to a change in focus, and a lack of a readily available safety net for guidance. It's important to acknowledge that these challenges can manifest differently based on individual personality and prior experience; some ICs struggle more with delegation than others. The core of this shift is moving from *doing* work to *enabling* others to do their best work.

## A Multi-Faceted Support System

A comprehensive approach is key to setting up new managers for success. Here’s a layered system that can provide the necessary support:

**1. Dedicated 1:1s:** Regular, focused one-on-one meetings are critical. These shouldn’t be just status updates, but rather opportunities for coaching, mentorship, and problem-solving. Focus on:

*   **Strategic Guidance:** Help them think through the long-term implications of decisions and guide them on how to navigate political dynamics within the organization.
*   **Feedback and Coaching:** Provide constructive feedback on their leadership style and offer coaching on specific skills.
*   **Problem Solving:**  Offer support in navigating challenging situations with team members or stakeholders.

**2. Peer Support:**  New managers benefit greatly from connecting with others in similar roles. Consider:

*   Creating a dedicated Slack channel or scheduling regular “new manager roundtable” sessions.
*   Encouraging peer mentorship – pairing a new manager with a more experienced one.
*   Facilitating opportunities for knowledge sharing and best practice exchange.

**3. Formal Training:**  Investing in relevant training programs can equip new managers with the necessary skills.  Look for programs that focus on:

*   Leadership skills (communication, conflict resolution, performance management).
*   Engineering-specific leadership – how to guide technical decisions without being the expert.
*   Emotional Intelligence and self-awareness.

**4. Mentorship:** Pairing new managers with experienced leaders provides valuable guidance and support. When selecting a mentor, prioritize:

*   A compatible style and experience level.
*   Someone who is willing to dedicate the time and effort required to provide meaningful guidance.
*   A strong rapport and open communication.



## The Power of Filling the Gaps

Experienced managers often take certain tasks for granted – the “invisible” work that keeps things running smoothly. Proactively identify and address these areas to support your new managers. Consider providing support with:

*   **Meeting Templates & Agendas:** Provide pre-built templates for team meetings, 1:1s, and performance reviews.
*   **Cross-Functional Collaboration:**  Help them navigate relationships with other teams and stakeholders.
*   **Performance Reviews & Feedback:**  Offer guidance on conducting effective performance reviews and delivering constructive feedback.
*   **Managing Up:**  Help them learn how to effectively communicate with *their* managers and advocate for their team’s needs.
*   **Organizational Onboarding:** Ensure they understand company policies, processes, and norms.

## Combining Support & Addressing Organizational Needs

Proactive onboarding goes beyond simply explaining policies; it requires a deliberate effort to integrate the new manager into the company's culture and workflow.  This can involve:

*   **Shadowing Opportunities:**  Allowing the new manager to shadow experienced leaders in different departments.
*   **Key Stakeholder Introductions:**  Facilitating introductions to key stakeholders across the organization.
*   **Access to Internal Resources:**  Ensuring they have access to relevant documentation, tools, and resources.




## New Manager Skill Matrix

This matrix provides a concrete tool for 1:1s and development planning.

| Skill                      | Needs Development | Developing | Proficient | Strengths |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Delegation                |                   |            |            |           |
| Feedback Delivery          |                   |            |            |           |
| Conflict Resolution        |                   |            |            |           |
| Prioritization            |                   |            |            |           |
| Performance Management    |                   |            |            |           |
| Technical Guidance         |                   |            |            |           |

Use this in 1:1s to collaboratively identify areas for growth *and* acknowledge strengths, and create a tailored development plan. This helps focus conversations and track progress.
