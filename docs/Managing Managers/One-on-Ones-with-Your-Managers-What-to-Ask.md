## Level Up Your 1:1s: A Guide for Proactive Employees

Are your 1:1s feeling unproductive? Do you often leave meetings feeling unheard or like nothing meaningful was accomplished? This guide is for individual contributors who want to take ownership of their 1:1s and build a stronger, more productive relationship with their manager. We’ll show you how to shift the conversation from status updates to problem-solving and growth, maximizing the value of these crucial meetings.

### Framing Your 1:1

Traditionally, 1:1s are seen as check-in meetings for project updates. But they can be *so much more*.  The key is to proactively frame the meeting as a conversation, not a report. 

*   **Pre-Share the Agenda:** Sharing your agenda 24 hours in advance allows your manager time to prepare and ensures a more focused conversation.
*   **Conversation Starters:**  Transform typical agenda items into opportunities for discussion.  Instead of listing “Project Alpha Status,” try “Project Alpha – I’m anticipating a potential delay due to X. Let’s brainstorm solutions.”
*   **Come Prepared:** Bring specific topics you want to discuss, questions you have, and potential solutions you've considered.

### Key Question Categories to Drive Meaningful Conversations

Here’s a breakdown of question categories you can use to structure your 1:1s.  Don't try to cover *everything* in every meeting. Choose a few relevant topics based on your current needs.

**1. Unblocking & Prioritization**

This is about ensuring you have the resources and clarity you need to succeed.

*   “I’m currently focused on X, Y, and Z. Are these still the highest priority? Should I shift my focus anywhere?”
*   “I’m blocked on [specific issue].  I’ve considered A and B as potential solutions.  What are your thoughts?”
*   “I'm feeling overwhelmed with my current workload. Can we discuss how to best prioritize my tasks?”

**2.  Progress & Challenges**

Go beyond simply reporting status; discuss what's *behind* the numbers.

*   “Project Alpha is on track, but I’m concerned about [potential risk].  What steps can we take to mitigate this?”
*   “I successfully completed X this week. I learned [key takeaway] in the process. How can I apply this to future projects?”
*   “I’m struggling with [specific skill or task]. Are there any resources or training opportunities that could help?”

**3.  Strategic Alignment & Vision**

Understanding the bigger picture helps you make more informed decisions and ensures your work aligns with overall company goals.

*   “Can you share any updates on the company’s overall strategy? How does my work contribute to these goals?”
*   “I’m exploring a new approach to [problem].  Does this align with the long-term vision for [area]?”
*   “What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) we’re focusing on this quarter, and how can I best contribute to achieving them?”

**4.  Career Growth & Development**

Don't be afraid to discuss your career aspirations.  Your 1:1 is a great opportunity to get feedback and guidance.

*   “I’m interested in developing my skills in [area]. Are there any opportunities for training or mentorship?”
*   “I’m excited about [potential career path].  What steps can I take to prepare for this?”
*   “Can we discuss my performance goals for the next quarter? I’d like to focus on [specific areas].”

**5. Removing Roadblocks/Escalations**

Sometimes, you need to bring up issues that require your manager's attention or intervention.

*   “I'm facing a challenge with [cross-functional team/process] that’s impacting my ability to deliver on X. Could we discuss how to resolve this?”
*    “I’ve identified a potential process improvement for [area]. I’d like to get your input on how to implement it.”
*   “I need your support in getting approval for [resource/budget] to successfully complete [project].”

**6. Feedback & Process Improvement**

Show your manager you value their time and are committed to continuous improvement.

*   “What can *I* do to make these meetings more valuable for *you*?”
*  “Are there any areas where you’d like me to provide more detail during our 1:1s?”
*  “What can we do to improve our communication and collaboration as a team?”



### Turning Questions into Conversations

It’s not enough to just *ask* the questions.  Here’s how to turn them into productive conversations:

*   **Practice Active Listening:** Pay attention to your manager’s responses, ask clarifying questions, and summarize their points to ensure understanding.
*   **Come Prepared with Context:** Provide enough background information so your manager can quickly understand the issue.
*   **Be Open to Feedback:**  Welcome constructive criticism and be willing to adjust your approach based on your manager’s guidance.
*   **Follow Up on Action Items:**  If you agree on any action items, make sure to follow up on them and keep your manager informed of your progress.

**Remember**: Your 1:1 is a two-way street. Be proactive, be prepared, and be open to dialogue. By taking ownership of this meeting, you can build a stronger relationship with your manager, accelerate your career growth, and contribute more effectively to your team's success.
