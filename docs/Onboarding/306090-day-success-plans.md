# Building a Robust 30/60/90-Day Plan

Onboarding new engineers effectively is crucial for team success, yet it's often overlooked. A poorly onboarded engineer can take months to reach full productivity, costing valuable time and resources. A well-structured 30/60/90-day plan provides a roadmap for new hires, accelerating their ramp-up and ensuring they become valuable contributors quickly. This article provides a practical guide for engineering managers to create and implement a robust plan.

## Why a 30/60/90-Day Plan Matters

A 30/60/90-day plan isn't just about checking boxes; it's about setting your new engineers up for long-term success. Without a plan, new hires often feel lost, struggle to prioritize, and contribute less effectively. A clear plan provides:

* **Clarity:** Defines expectations and goals for the initial months.
* **Focus:** Helps the new hire prioritize tasks and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
* **Structure:** Provides a framework for learning and integration.
* **Accountability:** Facilitates regular check-ins and progress tracking.
* **Faster Ramp-Up:**  Accelerates the time it takes for the new hire to become a productive member of the team.

## The Phased Approach: A Practical Guide

Here's a breakdown of a phased approach, with specific deliverables for each stage:

### Phase 1: First 30 Days – Learning & Foundation

**Focus:** Understanding the team, codebase, processes, and initial priorities.

* **Goals:**
    * Get acquainted with team members and company culture.
    * Understand the architecture and key components of the codebase.
    * Set up the development environment and tools.
    * Complete initial onboarding tasks (e.g., HR paperwork, security training).
    * Identify a small, achievable "quick win" project.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Shared document listing key contacts** with brief bios and areas of expertise.
    * **Codebase overview document** or walkthrough.
    * **List of essential tools and resources.**
    * **Completed onboarding tasks checklist.**
    * **"Quick win" project completed.**

### Phase 2: 30-60 Days – Contribution & Collaboration

**Focus:**  Making meaningful contributions to the team, tackling more complex tasks, and actively participating in code reviews and discussions.

* **Goals:**
    * Contribute to ongoing projects with increasing independence.
    * Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback.
    * Understand and adhere to coding standards and best practices.
    * Identify areas for personal and professional development.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Successfully contributed code to a core project.**
    * **Participated in at least 5 code reviews (as both reviewer and reviewee).**
    * **Documented a key process or component.**
    * **Proactively discussed potential skill gaps and development opportunities with their manager.** 
    * **Started exploring relevant technologies or frameworks.**

### Phase 3: 60-90 Days – Ownership & Expansion

**Focus:**  Taking ownership of larger tasks, mentoring junior engineers (if applicable), and contributing to team improvements.

* **Goals:**
    * Independently manage and deliver features or bug fixes.
    * Identify and address areas for improvement in the codebase or processes.
    * Mentor or assist junior engineers (if appropriate).
    * Contribute to technical documentation or knowledge sharing.
* **Deliverables:**
    * **Independently delivered a significant feature or bug fix.**
    * **Led a technical discussion or presented a learning to the team.**
    * **Documented a complex process or system component.**
    * **Identified and proposed a solution to a team challenge.**
    * **Mentored a junior engineer or assisted with onboarding (if applicable).**

## Beyond the Plan: Consistent Check-Ins & Adaptability

A 30/60/90-day plan isn’t a rigid document; it's a living roadmap. Consistent check-ins are crucial for ensuring progress and making necessary adjustments. Use these 1:1s as dedicated "30/60/90 plan review" sessions to ensure alignment and address any roadblocks. 

* **Regular 1:1 meetings:** Schedule weekly or bi-weekly meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and goals.
* **Open communication:** Encourage the new hire to ask questions and share feedback.
* **Flexibility:** Be prepared to adapt the plan based on the new hire's progress and evolving team priorities.  Remember the initial plan is a working hypothesis – be prepared to adjust it based on reality.
* **Celebrate successes:** Acknowledge and celebrate milestones achieved.

## Setting Your New Engineers Up for Success

A well-executed 30/60/90-day plan is an investment in your team's future. By providing clear expectations, structured learning, and consistent support, you can accelerate the ramp-up process and empower your new engineers to become valuable contributors from day one.
