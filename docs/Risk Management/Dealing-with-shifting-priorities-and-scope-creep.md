# Dealing with Shifting Priorities and Scope Creep

It’s a constant reality for engineering leaders: plans change. Whether it’s a new market opportunity, shifting business goals, or simply a better understanding of user needs, priorities inevitably shift. This isn't a sign of failure; it's the nature of building products. However, unchecked shifting priorities and scope creep can quickly lead to burnout, missed deadlines, and a demoralized team. This article explores how to build a system to navigate these challenges, turning potential chaos into opportunity.

## The Problem: Shifting Priorities & Scope Creep

Shifting priorities and scope creep manifest in several ways. You might encounter the "creeping feature" – small, seemingly innocuous requests that gradually expand the project’s scope. Or you may face constant re-prioritization of tasks, leaving the team feeling like they're chasing a moving target.  This creates a frustrating environment where engineers struggle to focus, leading to reduced productivity and decreased quality.

## Building a Framework for Resilience

The key is to move beyond reactive firefighting and build a proactive system to manage change. This isn’t about *eliminating* change; it’s about embracing it in a controlled and sustainable way. 

### Prioritization Techniques

Effective prioritization is the cornerstone of handling shifting priorities. Start with a clear understanding of your overall business goals and product strategy. Then, utilize a prioritization framework to objectively evaluate new requests and adjust existing plans. Some popular methods include:

* **RICE Scoring:** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) – A simple and effective method for quantifying the value of different features.
* **MoSCoW Method:** (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have) – Categorizes features based on their importance.
* **Value vs. Effort Matrix:** Plots features based on their potential value and the effort required to implement them.

Choose the method that best suits your team and consistently apply it to ensure transparent and data-driven decision-making.

### Formalizing Change Requests

Establish a clear process for submitting and evaluating change requests. This should include:

* **A Standard Submission Form:**  Ensures all requests include necessary information (description, justification, estimated effort, impact).
* **Regular Review Meetings:**  Dedicated time to discuss new requests, assess their impact on existing priorities, and make informed decisions.
* **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the ripple effect of the change on timelines, resources, and other ongoing projects.

Implementing this process can initially meet resistance from stakeholders. Be prepared to emphasize the benefits: increased predictability, reduced burnout, and a more focused development effort.

### Capacity Planning & Resource Allocation

Understanding your team's capacity is crucial. This isn’t just about headcount; it’s about available *time* and *bandwidth*. 

* **Estimate Capacity:** Utilize techniques like story points and velocity tracking (in Agile methodologies) to gauge how much work the team can realistically handle in a given sprint or iteration.
* **Buffer for Unexpected Work:**  Account for unforeseen issues, bugs, and maintenance tasks.
* **Be Realistic and Say “No”:**  It’s better to be upfront about limitations than to overcommit and deliver subpar results. Protecting your team’s wellbeing is paramount.



### Visualizing Priorities: The "Now, Next, Later" Board

A simple yet powerful tool for communicating priorities is the “Now, Next, Later” board. This visual aid divides tasks into three categories:

* **Now:** Tasks the team is actively working on.
* **Next:** Tasks scheduled to be started soon.
* **Later:** Tasks that are important but not immediately prioritized.

[Here’s a link to a visual example of a Now/Next/Later board](https://trello.com/now-next-later).  This transparency helps everyone understand the current focus and provides context for potential shifts.

## Empowering Your Team

Building a resilient system isn't just about processes; it’s about empowering your team.

### Delegation & Growth Opportunities

Provide opportunities for engineers to take ownership and contribute to strategic decisions. This fosters a sense of responsibility and encourages proactive problem-solving.

### Communication & Transparency: The Cornerstones of Trust

Keep your team informed about changes, even if they’re minor. Explain the rationale behind decisions and solicit their feedback. Open and honest communication builds trust and fosters a collaborative environment.

### Recognizing and Addressing Burnout

Pay attention to signs of burnout within your team. Encourage breaks, promote work-life balance, and provide support when needed.  A healthy and engaged team is far more resilient in the face of change.



## A Real-World Example

I recently worked with a team struggling with constant priority shifts. We implemented a change request process, started using a Now/Next/Later board, and empowered the team to participate in prioritization discussions. One new engineer, initially hesitant to speak up, started voicing concerns about the feasibility of certain requests. This feedback proved invaluable, preventing potential roadblocks and ensuring we delivered a high-quality product on time.


## Final Thoughts

Shifting priorities are inevitable, but they don’t have to derail your team. By implementing a proactive system, empowering your engineers, and fostering open communication, you can navigate change effectively and build a resilient, high-performing team. Remember, it’s not about avoiding change; it’s about embracing it in a way that benefits both your team and your product.
