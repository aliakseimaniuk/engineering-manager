# The Shift from Tactical to Strategic: Leading Managers, Not Just Tasks

Moving from managing individual contributors to managing managers is a significant leap. It’s a shift that requires letting go of deeply ingrained habits and embracing a new mindset. You’re no longer focused on *doing* the work, but on enabling others to do *their* best work. This isn’t just about delegating; it’s about building a high-performing team of leaders who can execute a shared vision. It’s a challenging transition, and many new managers struggle with the emotional adjustment of relinquishing control and trusting their teams. This article will outline key strategies for navigating this shift and becoming an effective leader of leaders.

## Understanding the “Why” Beyond the Requirements

One of the biggest changes is understanding that your role isn’t simply to ensure tasks are completed, but to connect those tasks to the bigger picture.  Your team needs to understand *why* they're doing what they're doing.  Instead of just telling your team “We're building feature X,” explain *how* it will address a key customer pain point or help achieve a strategic goal like expanding into a new market. When your managers understand the ‘why’ behind their work, they are empowered to make informed decisions, prioritize effectively, and motivate their teams. 

## Setting Objectives and Measuring Success with OKRs

Establishing clear objectives and key results (OKRs) is crucial for aligning your team around shared goals. OKRs provide a framework for setting ambitious yet measurable targets, ensuring everyone is working towards the same outcomes. However, be mindful of potential pitfalls. Setting unrealistic goals can demotivate your team, and focusing solely on quantity over quality can lead to burnout. The key is to strike a balance between ambition and achievability, and to regularly review and adjust your OKRs based on performance and changing priorities.

## Empowering Your Managers: Delegation Beyond Tasks

True empowerment goes beyond simply assigning tasks. It's about creating an environment where your managers feel trusted, supported, and accountable. This means giving them the autonomy to make decisions, take risks, and learn from their mistakes. Trust isn’t given immediately; it's earned through consistent support, clear communication, and demonstrating confidence in your managers' abilities.

* **Clear Boundaries and Decision-Making Frameworks:** Define clear decision-making authority. For example, managers might be empowered to independently approve budgets up to $5,000, while larger expenditures require escalation. They should also have autonomy over hiring and performance management within their teams, with your guidance and oversight.
* **Investing in Development:** Provide opportunities for your managers to grow their skills and leadership capabilities. This could include mentorship programs, leadership training, or opportunities to attend industry conferences.

## Fostering Alignment & Communication

Maintaining open and consistent communication is essential for ensuring everyone is on the same page. This means proactively sharing information, soliciting feedback, and encouraging dialogue.

* **Regular One-on-Ones:** Schedule regular one-on-one meetings with each of your managers to discuss their progress, challenges, and goals. This is a valuable opportunity to provide coaching, offer support, and build strong relationships.
* **Team Meetings:** Hold regular team meetings to share updates, discuss priorities, and foster collaboration.
* **Shared Documentation & Transparency:** Utilize tools like shared project management platforms (Asana, Jira, Trello) and internal wikis (Confluence, Notion) to ensure everyone has access to the information they need.

* **Skip-Level Check-ins:** While valuable, skip-level check-ins should be approached with caution. Focus on gathering insights, not circumventing your direct reports. Frame the conversation as seeking their perspective on broader organizational challenges or opportunities. Be transparent about the purpose of the meeting, and always loop in the manager afterwards. A poorly handled skip-level can damage trust and create friction.

## Beyond the To-Do List: The Importance of “Managerial Courage”

Leading managers requires a different kind of courage than managing individual contributors. It’s about having difficult conversations, making tough decisions, and taking risks.

* **Saying "No" to Good Ideas:**  It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new ideas, but as a leader, you need to be able to prioritize and say "no" to projects that don't align with your strategic goals.  Frame the “no” constructively – e.g., "We're prioritizing X right now, but let's revisit this in Q2."
* **Addressing Performance Issues:** Don't shy away from addressing performance issues.  Provide constructive feedback, offer support, and hold your managers accountable for results.
* **Championing Your Managers:**  Be their advocate and have their back, especially in difficult situations.  For example, if a manager is facing resistance from another team, step in and help them navigate the situation.

## The Shift in Focus: From "What" to "Who"

Ultimately, the biggest shift in mindset is moving from focusing on *what* needs to be done to focusing on *who* is doing the work. Your job isn’t to be the smartest person in the room or the one with all the answers. It’s to create an environment where your managers can thrive, innovate, and achieve their full potential.

Below that, radiating outwards: "Manager 1", "Manager 2", "Manager 3", etc.  Each manager has lines connecting to "Teams" and "Individual Contributors".  The central figure - YOU - has arrows pointing *to* the managers, representing support, coaching, and guidance, not direction.)**




This transition isn’t easy, but it’s essential for building a high-performing organization. By embracing these strategies and focusing on empowering your managers, you can unlock their potential and achieve remarkable results.
