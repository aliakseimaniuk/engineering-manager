# The Shift from Managing Engineers to Managing Managers

You were a successful engineer, then a great engineering manager… now you’re responsible for *other* managers. What changed? And how do you succeed in this new role? This transition can be challenging, requiring a shift in focus from individual contribution and direct technical oversight to coaching, systems building, and leveraging the skills of others. This article outlines the key differences between managing engineers and managing managers, providing practical advice to help you thrive in your new leadership role.

## The Shift in Responsibility

As an engineering manager, you were likely deeply involved in the technical details of your team’s work. You provided guidance, reviewed code, and unblocked issues. Now, your primary responsibility is to empower *your* managers to do the same for their teams. This means less direct technical involvement and more focus on strategic direction, team health, and individual development. It’s about building a high-performing organization through its leaders, not just managing individual tasks.

## Key Differences in Focus

The table below highlights the key differences in focus between managing engineers and managing managers:

| Feature | Managing Engineers | Managing Managers |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary Focus** | Technical execution & delivery | Leadership development & organizational health |
| **Daily Activities** | Code reviews, technical design discussions, bug fixing, task assignment | 1:1 coaching, performance reviews, strategic planning, conflict resolution |
| **Key Metrics** | Code quality, velocity, bug count, on-time delivery | Team morale, manager growth, employee retention, overall team performance |
| **Level of Technical Involvement** | High - actively involved in technical details | Low - focus on strategic guidance and removing roadblocks |
| **Success Measurement** | Individual and team technical achievements | Team effectiveness, manager development, and organizational impact |

## The Importance of 1:1s (Revisited)

Your 1:1s with your managers should be significantly different than those you held with individual engineers.  While technical discussions may still occasionally occur, the primary focus should be on their growth as leaders. Here are some questions to guide your conversations:

* What are your biggest challenges as a leader right now?
* What support do you need from me to be successful?
* How are you developing your team members?
* What are your long-term career goals?
* How are *you* feeling about the challenges your team is facing?
* What opportunities do you see for improving team processes?

## Building Systems and Trust

Creating the right systems is crucial for empowering your managers and fostering a healthy organization.  Here's how to approach it:

* **Performance Reviews:** Ensure consistent and fair evaluations across all teams, focusing on leadership behaviors *and* team outcomes. Consider 360-degree feedback to get a well-rounded perspective.
* **Career Development:** Implement a structured career development program for managers, providing opportunities for training, mentorship, and stretch assignments.
* **Communication Channels:** Establish clear communication channels to facilitate information sharing and collaboration between teams.
* **Decision-Making Processes:** Define clear decision-making processes to empower managers to make informed decisions without constant escalation.
* **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a process for resolving conflicts quickly and effectively, empowering managers to address issues within their teams.
* **Goal Setting:** Collaborate with managers to set clear, measurable goals that align with the overall organizational strategy.

## Recognizing When to Delegate (Really)

It’s tempting to jump in and fix things when you see a problem, but resisting this urge is crucial. Your role is to empower your managers to solve their own problems and learn from their mistakes. When a manager comes to you with a challenge, ask these questions:

* What steps have you already taken to address the issue?
* What are your proposed solutions?
* What are the potential downsides of intervening directly?
* What support do you need from me to implement your solution?

By asking these questions, you’ll help your manager develop their problem-solving skills and build confidence.

## Letting Go and Trusting Your Team

One of the biggest challenges in transitioning to managing managers is letting go of control. It's natural to want to ensure everything is done correctly, but micromanaging will stifle your managers’ growth and damage their morale. Trust your team, empower them to make decisions, and provide them with the support they need to succeed.  

## Conclusion

The transition from managing engineers to managing managers requires a fundamental shift in mindset and approach. By focusing on leadership development, building strong systems, and empowering your team, you can create a high-performing organization that thrives on innovation and collaboration. Remember, your success is now measured by the success of your managers and the teams they lead.
