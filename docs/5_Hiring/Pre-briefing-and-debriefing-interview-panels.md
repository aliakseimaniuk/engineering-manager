# The Power of Pre-Briefing and Debriefing

This article addresses a common pain point in engineering hiring: inconsistent decision-making. It provides practical, actionable advice to improve the consistency and quality of your technical hiring process.

## The Problem: Inconsistent Hiring

Engineering teams often struggle with making consistent hiring decisions. This can lead to suboptimal hires, wasted time, and frustration for everyone involved. Common contributing factors include:

* **Differing Priorities:** Interviewers may prioritize different criteria when evaluating candidates.
* **Repetitive Questions:**  Candidates are often asked similar questions by multiple interviewers, leading to inefficient use of time.
* **Unconscious Bias:** Subjective interpretations can creep into the evaluation process, potentially leading to unfair or suboptimal decisions.
* **Lack of Shared Understanding:** A lack of clear expectations and shared understanding of the ideal candidate profile.

## The Solution: Pre-Briefing & Debriefing

The key to addressing these challenges lies in establishing a structured approach to interviewing, centered around pre-briefing and debriefing sessions.

### What are Pre-Briefing and Debriefing?

**Pre-Briefing:** A short meeting *before* the interviews to ensure all interviewers are aligned on the role, the ideal candidate profile, and evaluation criteria.

**Debriefing:** A meeting *after* the interviews to discuss each candidate's performance, share observations, and reach a consensus decision.

## Pre-Briefing: Setting the Stage for Success

The pre-briefing session should cover the following:

* **Role Overview:** Briefly revisit the role's responsibilities, key challenges, and the team's goals.
* **Ideal Candidate Profile:** Clearly define the skills, experience, and qualities of the ideal candidate. What *must* they have? What's nice to have?
* **Evaluation Criteria:**  Establish clear and objective criteria for evaluating candidates. Focus on behaviors and observable skills, not just subjective impressions.
* **Interview Plan:** Review the interview schedule, the topics each interviewer will cover, and the overall flow.
* **Mitigating Bias:** Discuss potential unconscious biases and how to avoid them.  Establishing objective criteria *before* reviewing any candidate information is crucial.

**Example Pre-Brief Document (Shared Online):**

| Section | Details |
|---|---|
| **Role:** | Senior Backend Engineer |
| **Team:** | Payments |
| **Must-Have Skills:** |  Proficiency in Java, experience with microservices architecture, strong database skills (PostgreSQL). |
| **Nice-to-Have:** | Experience with Kafka, AWS experience. |
| **Key Evaluation Areas:** | Problem-solving ability, system design skills, communication skills. |



## Debriefing:  Analyzing and Deciding

The debriefing session is where the real work happens.  Here’s how to make it effective:

* **Structured Discussion:** Go through each candidate one by one.
* **Behavioral Evidence:**  Focus on *specific examples* of the candidate’s behavior during the interview.  Avoid generalizations. (e.g., "The candidate described a time when they successfully debugged a complex production issue," instead of "The candidate is a strong problem solver.")
* **Scorecard Utilization:** Use a standardized scorecard to evaluate each candidate against the pre-defined criteria.
* **Open & Honest Feedback:** Encourage open and honest feedback from all interviewers.
* **Consensus Building:**  Work towards a consensus decision based on the evidence presented.
* **Document Decisions:** Record the rationale behind the hiring decision, including both positive and negative feedback.

**Example Scorecard:**

| Skill | Rating (1-5) | Behavioral Indicators | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Problem Solving** | 4 | Proactively identifies issues, Offers creative solutions, Analyzes data before making decisions | Candidate walked us through a complex debugging scenario with clear steps. |
| **System Design** | 3 |  Understands scalability concepts,  Can articulate tradeoffs between different architectural approaches,  Considers security implications. | Candidate’s design lacked detail regarding fault tolerance. |
| **Communication** | 5 |  Clearly articulates technical concepts,  Active listener,  Adapts communication style to the audience. | Excellent communication skills – explained complex ideas clearly and concisely. |

**Rating Scale:**

* **1 - Unsatisfactory:**  Demonstrates little to no understanding or proficiency in the skill.
* **2 - Needs Improvement:**  Demonstrates limited understanding or proficiency in the skill and requires significant development.
* **3 - Meets Expectations:**  Demonstrates a satisfactory level of understanding and proficiency in the skill.
* **4 - Exceeds Expectations:**  Demonstrates a strong understanding and proficiency in the skill and consistently delivers high-quality work.
* **5 - Exceptional:** Demonstrates mastery of the skill and is a recognized expert in the field.

**Handling Disagreements:**  When interviewers disagree, focus on the evidence.  Review the interview notes and specific examples of the candidate’s behavior to try to reach a consensus. If a consensus cannot be reached, involve a neutral third party to help mediate the discussion.

## Real-World Implementation & Addressing Challenges

While these processes are straightforward, consistent implementation requires effort. Here are a few tips:

* **Dedicated Time:** Schedule pre-briefing and debriefing sessions well in advance.
* **Facilitator:** Designate a facilitator to keep the meetings on track.
* **Documentation:** Encourage thorough documentation of interview notes and feedback.
* **Remote Teams:** For remote teams, leverage video conferencing and shared documents to facilitate collaboration.



## The Benefits:  Improved Hiring Outcomes

By implementing a consistent pre-briefing and debriefing process, you can:

* **Reduce Bias:**  Ensure that hiring decisions are based on objective criteria.
* **Improve Consistency:**  Ensure that all interviewers are evaluating candidates against the same standards.
* **Increase Hiring Accuracy:**  Make more informed and accurate hiring decisions.
* **Enhance Candidate Experience:**  Provide a more consistent and professional experience for all candidates.
* **Save Time & Resources:**  Reduce the number of bad hires and the associated costs of turnover.
