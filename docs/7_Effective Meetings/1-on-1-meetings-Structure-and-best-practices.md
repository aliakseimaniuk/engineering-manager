## Mastering 1-on-1s for Engineering Managers: Beyond the Check-In

Effective 1-on-1s are the cornerstone of strong engineering leadership. They’re not just about task management; they’re about building relationships, fostering growth, and unlocking the full potential of your team. While studies show that employees who regularly meet with their managers are more engaged and productive, many 1-on-1s fall flat. This article moves beyond the "why" of regular meetings and focuses on the "how"—specifically tailored for engineering managers.

**Who is this for?** This article is designed for engineering managers who want to elevate their 1-on-1s from routine check-ins to impactful conversations.

### Why are 1-on-1s Different for Engineering Teams?

Engineering presents unique challenges. Unlike roles with highly defined, predictable tasks, engineers often grapple with undefined problem spaces, evolving requirements, and the inherent ambiguity of research & development. This ambiguity can lead to frustration and roadblocks. Regular 1-on-1s provide a crucial forum to discuss assumptions, explore different approaches, clarify expectations, and proactively address potential issues before they become critical. They’re also essential for career development in a field that demands continuous learning and adaptation. 

### The Anti-Status Update: Structuring for Impact

Let’s be clear: 1-on-1s are *not* just another status meeting. While dedicated status updates belong in other forums (like sprint stand-ups or project check-ins), a quick check-in on key priorities can be incorporated into the opening minutes. The primary goal should be to foster a dialogue that supports growth, removes obstacles, and builds a strong working relationship.  Here's a practical structure:

**1. Check-In (5-10 minutes):** Start with a human connection. 
   * *Example Questions:* “What’s been the biggest win this week?”, “What's been the most challenging aspect?”, "How are you feeling about your current workload?"

**2. Progress & Blockers (10-15 minutes):** Briefly discuss ongoing projects and identify any roadblocks. Focus on *what* is blocking progress, not just *that* there is a blockage.
   * *Example Questions:* “Are there any dependencies we need to address?”, “What can I do to help clear the path?”, “What are your top priorities this week?”

**3. Growth & Development (10-15 minutes):** Dedicate time to long-term career goals and skill development.
   * *Example Questions:* “What are you hoping to learn in the next quarter?”, “What skills do you want to develop?”, “Are there any training opportunities you’re interested in?”

**4. Action Items & Wrap-Up (5-10 minutes):**  Summarize key takeaways and define clear action items for both of you.  
   * *Example Questions:* “What are the next steps?”, “What support do you need from me?”, “When should we follow up on this?”

### Beyond the Agenda: Topics to Prioritize

Don’t limit the conversation to the structure above. Here are some key topics to weave into your 1-on-1s:

* **Career Development:** Discuss long-term goals, career paths, and opportunities for advancement.
* **Technical Challenges:** Dive deep into technical issues, brainstorm solutions, and provide support. Encourage engineers to share challenging problems they're tackling, even if they don't have a solution yet.
* **Feedback:** Give and solicit feedback on performance, code quality, design choices, collaboration skills, or specific technical contributions.  Focus on specific behaviors and outcomes, and frame feedback constructively.
* **Process Improvement:** Encourage engineers to identify areas for improvement in processes, tools, or workflows. Create a psychologically safe environment where they feel comfortable sharing suggestions without fear of criticism.
* **Recognition & Celebration:** Acknowledge and celebrate accomplishments, both big and small.  Wins in engineering can include successfully refactoring a complex codebase, solving a particularly challenging bug, or mentoring a junior engineer.

### Consistency vs. Effectiveness: Finding Your Rhythm

Consistency is valuable, but *effectiveness* is paramount. Don’t get so caught up in scheduling that you lose sight of the purpose of the meeting.  Experiment to find a rhythm that works for you and your team. Some engineers may benefit from more frequent check-ins (e.g., new hires, those facing significant challenges), while others may prefer less frequent but more in-depth conversations. Be adaptable and responsive to individual needs.

### The Power of Follow-Up

1-on-1s aren't just about having a conversation; they're about driving action. Document action items during the meeting and follow up on them promptly.  This demonstrates that you value your team member's time and are committed to supporting their growth. Utilize shared documents, project management tools, or even a simple email summary to track progress and maintain accountability.



By adopting these strategies, you can transform your 1-on-1s from routine check-ins into powerful conversations that unlock the full potential of your engineering team.
