# What to Delegate vs What to Own as a Manager

## Delegation Isn't About Laziness; It's About Leadership

This article provides practical advice on delegation for new managers, helping them unlock team potential and become more effective leaders.

**I. Why Delegation Matters**

Delegation isn’t about shirking responsibility; it’s about leveraging the strengths of your team and focusing on your core responsibilities. Effective delegation unlocks your team’s potential, accelerates innovation, and frees you up to focus on strategic initiatives. It requires trust, patience, and a willingness to let go – but the rewards are well worth the effort.

**II. What to Delegate: Identifying the Right Tasks**

Not everything should be delegated. Here’s a breakdown of tasks suitable for delegation, and those you should retain:

* **Well-Defined, Repeatable Tasks:** These are ideal for delegation, *but ensure clear documentation exists or is created before delegation*.  Think of tasks with established processes and predictable outcomes.
* **Tasks Aligned with Career Goals:**  Delegating tasks that help team members develop new skills and work towards their career aspirations is a win-win. *However, proactively discuss these goals with your team members to ensure alignment*.
* **Tasks That Stretch Team Members:**  Challenging tasks can foster growth and build confidence, but ensure appropriate support is provided.
* **Tasks Outside Your Core Responsibilities:**  Focus on what *you* uniquely contribute. Delegate anything that others can handle effectively.

**III. What to Keep: Tasks You Should Retain**

* **Strategic Planning:** High-level strategic decisions generally remain with the manager.
* **Performance Reviews & 1:1s:** Maintaining personal connections with your team is crucial.
* **Handling Critical Issues (Initially):** While you can delegate problem-solving, you may need to step in during major crises initially, mentoring your team as you do.
* **Building Key Relationships:** Certain relationships may require your direct involvement.



**IV. Addressing Common Concerns & Challenges**

* **Building Trust:** Trust isn't automatic. Demonstrate it by proactively seeking your team's input, publicly acknowledging their contributions, giving them ownership over outcomes (even with the potential for failure), and offering support when needed.
* **Handling Delegation Resistance:** Sometimes team members may not *want* a delegated task – perhaps they're overloaded, lack confidence, or don't see its value.  A conversation to understand their concerns and collaboratively find a solution is key.
* **Calibration and Feedback Loops:** Delegation isn’t “fire and forget.” Regular check-ins, not to oversee every detail, but to offer support and ensure alignment, are crucial.  Providing constructive feedback helps team members learn and improve.
* **The Importance of Documentation:** Ensure any delegated task has sufficient documentation before assigning it. This helps clarity and efficiency.
* **Avoiding Over-Delegation:** While learning to delegate is vital, avoid overwhelming your team. Be mindful of workloads and ensure balanced distribution of tasks.



**V.  The Delegation Matrix: A Visual Tool**

Use this matrix to help you decide what to delegate:

| **High Impact/High Complexity** | **Low Impact/Low Complexity** |
|---|---|
| **Delegate with Support & Mentorship:** Tasks that stretch skills but require guidance.  *Example: Leading a new feature development with close oversight.* | **Delegate Fully:** Routine tasks that free up your time. *Example: Data entry or report generation.* |
| **Do Yourself (Initially):** Critical tasks that require your unique expertise. *Example: Defining overall product strategy.* | **Eliminate/Automate:** Tasks that provide little value and can be removed or automated. *Example: Manual approval processes that can be automated.* |

**VI.  What to Own: Tasks That Remain With You**

* **Strategic Planning:** High-level strategic decisions generally remain with the manager.
* **Performance Reviews & 1:1s:** Maintaining personal connections with your team is crucial.
* **Handling Critical Issues (Initially):** While you can delegate problem-solving, you may need to step in during major crises initially, mentoring your team as you do.
* **Building Key Relationships:** Certain relationships may require your direct involvement.

**VII. Embracing "Good Enough"**

Embrace "good enough" *when it meets the requirements and is delivered on time*. Don’t settle for shoddy work, but prioritize delivering value over perfection. Encourage your team to focus on delivering results, not necessarily achieving flawless execution in every instance.

**VIII. Post-Incident Review & Continuous Improvement**

After any delegated task – especially those involving critical issues – conduct a post-incident review. Discuss what went well, what could be improved, and how to prevent similar issues in the future. This fosters a culture of learning and continuous improvement.

**IX. Delegation Isn't About Laziness; It's About Leadership**

Remember, effective delegation isn’t about offloading work; it's about empowering your team, fostering growth, and maximizing your collective impact. By embracing these principles, you can become a more effective leader and unlock the full potential of your team.
