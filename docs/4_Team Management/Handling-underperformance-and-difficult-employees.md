# Handling underperformance and difficult employees

## Navigating the Toughest Conversations in Engineering Leadership

These conversations are never easy, but addressing performance issues proactively is essential for building a high-performing team. This guide provides a practical framework for engineering leaders to navigate underperformance and challenging employee behaviors, turning difficult situations into opportunities for growth.

### Understanding the Root Causes

Before addressing the issue, it's crucial to understand *why* an employee is struggling. Here’s a breakdown of common root causes:

* **Skill Gap:** The employee lacks the necessary technical skills or knowledge to perform their tasks effectively. *Potential Solution:* Consider mentorship, training courses, or pairing with a more experienced engineer.
* **Lack of Motivation:** The employee is disengaged, uninspired, or lacks a clear understanding of their role and its importance. *Potential Solution:* Discuss career goals, provide challenging assignments, and offer opportunities for growth.
* **Personal Issues:** External factors (personal stress, family problems) are affecting the employee’s performance. *Potential Solution:* Offer empathy and support, and consider offering resources like Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs). (Respect boundaries and avoid delving into personal details.)
* **Process/System Issues:** Obstacles within the team or organization hinder the employee’s ability to succeed. *Potential Solution:* Streamline processes, provide necessary tools and access, and remove roadblocks. (e.g., Are developers constantly blocked waiting for environment access? Is the build process slow and cumbersome?)
* **Poor Communication:** Misunderstandings, lack of clarity, or insufficient feedback contribute to the issue. *Potential Solution:* Implement regular one-on-one meetings, provide clear expectations, and encourage open dialogue.
* **Conflict with Colleagues:** Interpersonal issues disrupt teamwork and negatively impact performance. *Potential Solution:* Facilitate mediation or coaching to address the conflict and foster a more collaborative environment.

A helpful tool for identifying root causes is a Fishbone Diagram (also known as an Ishikawa diagram). You can learn more about creating one here: [https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/new-fishbone.htm](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/new-fishbone.htm)



### Having the Conversation

Once you've identified the potential root cause, it’s time to have a direct and constructive conversation with the employee. Here’s how:

1. **Set the Stage:** Schedule a private, dedicated meeting. Open by stating your intention to discuss performance and collaboratively identify areas for improvement. (e.g., "I'd like to discuss how things are going with the X project and see if we can identify any ways to improve.")
2. **Be Specific:**  Avoid vague feedback. Provide concrete examples of the behaviors or results that are concerning. (e.g., Instead of "Your code quality is slipping," say "I've noticed an increase in bugs in your recent commits, specifically in the Y module.")
3. **Listen Actively:**  Allow the employee to share their perspective without interruption.  Practice active listening by summarizing what you heard and asking clarifying questions.  
4. **Focus on Behavior, Not Personality:**  Address the *what* and *how* of the issue, not the *who*. (e.g., Instead of "You're being uncooperative," say "I've observed you declining to participate in code reviews, which impacts the team’s ability to maintain code quality.")
5. **Collaborate on Solutions:**  Work with the employee to develop a clear action plan with specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.
6. **Document the Conversation:**  Clearly document the discussion, including the identified issues, agreed-upon action plan, and follow-up dates. Encourage the employee to document their understanding as well.

### Addressing Challenging Behaviors

Sometimes the issue isn't necessarily a lack of skill, but rather challenging interpersonal behavior. Here’s how to address it:

* **Focus on Professional Behavior:**  Even if there's no personal animosity, disruptive behavior is unacceptable.  
* **Set Clear Boundaries:**  Be direct and assertive in addressing unacceptable behavior. (e.g., "Interrupting colleagues: 'I need to finish my thought, please allow me to speak.' Spreading negativity: 'Let's focus on solutions, not dwell on problems.'")
* **Provide Constructive Feedback:**  Explain how the behavior impacts the team and the project.
* **Be Consistent:**  Enforce boundaries consistently and fairly.



### Knowing When to Cut Your Losses

Despite your best efforts, some situations may not improve.  Here are signs it might be time to consider more serious action:

* **Lack of Improvement:** The employee consistently fails to meet agreed-upon goals, despite receiving feedback and support.
* **Repeated Offenses:** The employee continues to engage in disruptive behavior despite warnings.
* **Negative Impact on Team Morale:** The employee’s behavior is negatively affecting the team's productivity and morale.

If you reach this point, consult with HR to discuss appropriate next steps, which may include a performance improvement plan (PIP) or, ultimately, termination.



### Important Considerations

* **Legal Compliance:**  Ensure all actions are consistent with company policies and relevant labor laws.
* **Documentation:** Maintain thorough and accurate documentation of all conversations and actions.
* **Consistency & Fairness:**  Treat all employees consistently and fairly.
* **HR Partnership:**  Involve HR throughout the process for guidance and support.

By following this framework, you can navigate difficult conversations with confidence, foster a more productive and positive work environment, and help your team members reach their full potential.
