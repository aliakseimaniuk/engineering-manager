# A Manager's Mindset

For two decades I’ve navigated the world of software engineering, first as a developer, then as a leader. I’ve seen brilliant engineers flourish under effective management and struggle under ineffective management. And the difference, consistently, comes down to mindset. Not technical skill, not process, but *how* a manager thinks about their role.

We often talk about “management skills” – delegation, prioritization, performance reviews. Those are important *tactics*. But tactics without a foundational mindset are… hollow. They’re things *done* to people, not *with* people. And that’s where things fall apart.

I recently had a conversation with a colleague – a truly gifted engineer. He expressed a frustration I’ve heard echoed countless times: feeling unheard, undervalued, and ultimately, seeing his ideas dismissed repeatedly by management. This wasn’t about seeking special treatment, but a desire for acknowledgement and a fair hearing. This dismissal manifested in a reluctance to contribute proactively in meetings, and a noticeable decline in the quality of his contributions. Ultimately, he was questioning his future at the company.

This isn’t about “being nice.” It’s about recognizing that motivated, engaged employees aren’t just *good* for morale; they are *essential* for a manager's own success. A manager whose team consistently delivers – not through fear or pressure, but through genuine engagement – *looks good*. They advance. They have more breathing room. They have a team that will go the extra mile. It’s a self-fulfilling, positive cycle. In fact, Gallup research consistently demonstrates that engaged teams are 21% more profitable.

**The Problem with "Doing" vs. "Enabling"**

Too many managers default to *doing*. They jump in to solve problems, dictate solutions, and control outcomes. While this *feels* productive in the short term, it actively stifles growth, innovation, and – crucially – team ownership.

I’ve made this mistake myself. Early in my career, I equated being a manager with *having* the answers. It took a hard lesson – watching a talented engineer become disengaged because I wouldn't let him *own* a problem – to realize that my job wasn’t to *solve* all the problems, but to *enable* my team to solve them.

**Shifting Your Mindset: Three Core Principles**

So, how do you cultivate a better managerial mindset? Here are three principles I’ve found crucial:

1. **Assume Positive Intent:** This seems simple, but it's surprisingly hard to practice consistently. When someone proposes an idea, *start* by assuming they believe it's a good one. Ask clarifying questions – “Help me understand your thinking here,” or “What problem are you trying to solve?” – rather than immediately pointing out flaws. This isn't about blind agreement; it’s about fostering a safe space for open communication.

2. **Focus on Growth, Not Just Output:**  Yes, delivering on deadlines is important. But consistently pushing for output at the expense of learning and development is short-sighted. Invest time in mentorship, provide opportunities for skill-building, and encourage experimentation.  Ask your team, “What can *we* learn from this?” after both successes and failures. A team that’s constantly growing is a team that will consistently outperform over the long term.

3. **Embrace the “Boredom Issues”:**  As one reader pointed out, a manager’s own satisfaction is directly linked to the engagement of their team. A disengaged team is a drag – a source of constant fires to fight and problems to solve. It's exhausting – and contributes to manager burnout. A study by the Maslach Burnout Inventory found that lack of control and recognition are significant contributors to burnout. Conversely, a motivated, empowered team allows you, as a manager, to focus on strategic thinking, innovation, and professional growth. It allows you to address those "boredom issues" by focusing on higher-level challenges.

**Visualizing the Shift: From Controller to Facilitator**

| **Controller** | **Facilitator** |
|---|---|
| Directs | Enables |
| Dictates | Guides |
| Monitors | Mentors |
| Controls | Empowers |

This visual highlights the core shift in mindset. It's not about giving up control; it’s about *sharing* control, fostering ownership, and ultimately, creating a more sustainable and fulfilling work environment. To move from Controller to Facilitator, start by actively soliciting input from your team before making decisions, even small ones. Instead of assigning tasks, ask, “How would *you* approach this?” and provide support and guidance rather than step-by-step instructions.

**The Long Game**

Genuine care – as someone put it in the initial feedback – isn’t a fluffy sentiment. It's a strategic imperative.  A manager who prioritizes their team’s growth, well-being, and sense of purpose will build a team that is resilient, innovative, and consistently delivers exceptional results. It’s a long game, but it’s the only one worth playing.

And ultimately, a thriving team isn’t just good for the company; it’s good for *you* as a manager. It allows you to lead with purpose, experience genuine satisfaction, and build a career you can be proud of.
