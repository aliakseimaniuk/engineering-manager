# A Manager's FAQs

I’ll never forget the new engineer who, during a one-on-one, confessed she was more worried about a conflict brewing between her roommates than about the looming code review. It caught me off guard, but it was a powerful reminder: people bring their whole selves to work. For years, I’ve told aspiring managers that the technical skills got you *to* the role, but people skills will determine your success *in* it. That’s often met with nods and polite agreement. But nothing truly prepares you for the sheer *weirdness* of being the person everyone comes to with…everything. It’s not just about code reviews and sprint planning. It’s the personal stuff, the career anxieties, the “what do I do about Karen in accounting?” questions. 

This isn't about having all the answers. It's about building the *capacity* to respond effectively, fostering trust, and ultimately, creating a team where people feel safe and supported. Here are some FAQs I’ve faced – and how I’ve learned to approach them.

## FAQ #1: "Can you help me with a conflict with someone in another team?"

This is *extremely* common. Engineers are problem solvers, and naturally, they’ll try to resolve issues themselves. But sometimes, those issues require navigation beyond their direct sphere of influence.

**The Trap:** Jumping in to *solve* it for them. This creates dependency and undermines their ability to build relationships.

**The Approach:** Facilitate *their* resolution. 
* **Listen actively:** Understand the situation from *their* perspective, without judgment.
* **Ask clarifying questions:** “What have *you* already tried? What’s the ideal outcome for you? What are *their* potential concerns?”
* **Role-play:**  "Let's rehearse what you might say. How can you frame this in a way that focuses on the shared goal?"
* **Offer to mediate (if appropriate):**  Only step in directly if it’s a genuine impasse and they’ve exhausted their options.

**Why it Matters:** You're teaching them crucial conflict resolution skills, building their emotional intelligence, and fostering cross-functional collaboration.



## FAQ #2: "I'm feeling burnt out. What should I do?"

This one hits hard. We often celebrate long hours and relentless dedication. But that's unsustainable. Ignoring burnout isn’t just bad for the individual; it’s devastating for the team. 

**The Trap:** Offering superficial fixes ("take a day off!") or dismissing their feelings.

**The Approach:** Deep listening and proactive support. Consider this scenario: an engineer comes to you, visibly stressed and admitting they’ve been working late every night for weeks. Start by acknowledging their experience: “That sounds incredibly tough. It’s completely understandable to feel that way.” Then, explore the root cause: “What’s contributing to this feeling? Is it workload, lack of clarity, feeling undervalued, something else?” Collaborate on solutions: “What can *we* do to address this? Can we redistribute tasks, prioritize differently, or explore ways to reduce stress?” Finally, encourage utilization of resources. Does your company offer mental health support, Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs), or other resources? 

**Why it Matters:** Showing genuine care builds trust and loyalty. It also forces you to address systemic issues that might be contributing to burnout within the team. (See visual suggestion: a simple flowchart outlining steps to take when a team member expresses burnout.)



## FAQ #3: "I'm not sure what my next career step should be."

This is a fantastic question, and a huge opportunity for a manager to provide meaningful guidance. It's also where many managers feel unsure how to proceed. 

**The Trap:** Giving unsolicited advice or pushing them towards a pre-defined path.

**The Approach:** Coaching, not directing. Start by focusing on strengths and interests: “What do you *enjoy* doing? What are you naturally good at? What problems do you find most engaging?” Then, explore options: “Have you considered technical leadership, architecture, or specializing in a specific technology? Let's brainstorm possibilities.” Connect them with mentors. Introduce them to people within the company or your network who have experience in areas they're interested in. Finally, help them create a development plan. Identify specific skills they need to acquire and resources to help them do so.

**Why it Matters:** Investing in your team’s career development not only boosts morale but also helps you retain top talent.



## FAQ #4: “This feels unfair.” (Regarding a performance review, project assignment, or other situation)

This is where empathy and transparency are crucial. Ignoring perceived injustices will erode trust and create resentment.

**The Trap:** Getting defensive or dismissing their concerns.

**The Approach:** Active listening and objective evaluation. Let them fully explain their perspective. Don’t interrupt. Ask clarifying questions. “Can you walk me through what led you to feel this way?” Objectively review the situation. Is there a valid basis for their concern? If so, acknowledge it. Explain the reasoning behind decisions. Transparency is key. Even if you can't change the outcome, explaining *why* it happened can help them understand.

**Why it Matters:** Demonstrates fairness and builds a culture of psychological safety where people feel comfortable raising concerns.




## The Core Skill: Genuine Support

Throughout all these interactions, there’s a common thread: *genuine support*. It's about seeing your team members as individuals, understanding their motivations, and supporting their growth. It’s not about being their friend, but about leading *as a human*. 

I recently came across a powerful quote by Maya Angelou: “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” [https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_385839](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/maya_angelou_385839) As managers, we’re not just responsible for delivering results; we’re responsible for shaping the experiences of the people who help us achieve those results. And that’s a responsibility worth taking seriously. 

It’s easy to get caught up in deadlines and deliverables, but intentionally investing in your team’s well-being is crucial for both their success and the success of your organization.
