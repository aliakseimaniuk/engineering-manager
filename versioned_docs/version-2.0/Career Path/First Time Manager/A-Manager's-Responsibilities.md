# A Manager's Responsibilities

For two decades, I've witnessed the evolution of engineering management. We've adopted Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and a bewildering array of other methodologies. We’ve obsessed over velocity, story points, and burn-down charts. And yet, I still see brilliant engineers consistently frustrated by…management. It's a recurring theme. Why? Because too often, we *define* management by what it *does* – task assignment, timeline enforcement – and not by what it *is*: a fundamental act of enabling others.

This isn’t about dismissing efficiency or process. It’s about recognizing that a manager's responsibilities extend far beyond project execution. It's about understanding that your team’s success – and ultimately, your own – hinges on *how* you approach those responsibilities. As one colleague, Ben Horowitz, famously said, “No manager, anywhere, cares about his subordinates.” It’s a harsh statement, but it struck a chord. It highlighted a critical gap in how many leaders operate, and a tendency to prioritize task completion over genuine team support.

So, let’s cut through the noise and define a manager’s *real* responsibilities.

## 1. Empowerment and Protection: Owning the "What" and Shielding the Team

This foundational principle centers on two key aspects: defining *what* needs to be built – the vision, the strategy, the requirements – while simultaneously protecting your team from distractions and external pressures. Your responsibility stops at defining the *what*; micro-managing the implementation is detrimental, leading to demotivation and stifled innovation.  

I remember a particularly frustrating project where my manager insisted on reviewing every line of code. It wasn’t about quality; it was about control. The result? Morale plummeted, timelines slipped, and the project was ultimately delayed. 

Clearly articulate the desired outcome and the constraints, then trust your team’s expertise. Provide guidance when asked, but resist the urge to dictate solutions.  Proactively identify potential roadblocks and address them before they impact your team. Be the single point of contact for external requests, ensuring your team can remain focused on building. 

## 2. Championing Growth and Development

Your team members aren't simply resources to be allocated; they are individuals with aspirations, strengths, and areas for development. Investing in their growth isn’t a "nice-to-have" – it's a fundamental responsibility. This means providing opportunities for learning, mentorship, and skill development. 

Dedicate time each week for 1:1s. Ask questions like: "What are you learning?" "What challenges are you facing?" "What are your career aspirations?". Help them create a personal development plan and provide support to achieve their goals. It's important to acknowledge that actively investing in your team’s growth requires effort and intentionality – and can be particularly challenging when faced with competing priorities. 

## 3. Accepting Responsibility

A natural extension of investing in your team’s growth is taking responsibility when things go wrong. It’s easy to celebrate successes, but true leadership means owning the outcome, even when it's negative.  

Too often, methodologies are implemented that inadvertently *shift* responsibility onto the developers. For example, overly rigid sprint commitments or unrealistic deadlines can create a culture of blame when projects fall behind. Blaming the team for missed deadlines or technical issues isn’t leadership – it's a lack of accountability. 

A manager *is* accountable for the team's performance. If a project fails, the manager needs to analyze what went wrong, identify lessons learned, and take steps to prevent similar failures in the future. This means owning the mistakes – even if they weren’t directly your fault. When a problem arises, resist the urge to immediately point fingers. Instead, focus on understanding the root cause. Facilitate a blameless post-mortem to identify lessons learned. Take ownership of the outcome and communicate transparently with stakeholders.

## Beyond Tasks: The Human Element

Ultimately, a manager's responsibilities are about more than just tasks and timelines. It’s about building a high-performing team by fostering a culture of trust, empowerment, and continuous growth. It’s about recognizing that motivated, engaged employees aren’t just more productive – they're the key to long-term success. 

It's about remembering that you’re not managing *tasks*; you're managing *people*. And that requires genuine care, empathy, and a commitment to their development.

**Next Steps:**

Take a moment to identify one area – perhaps empowerment, growth, or accountability – where you can immediately implement these principles with your team. Consider researching resources on effective leadership and employee engagement to deepen your understanding and refine your approach. The benefits – increased innovation, improved morale, and long-term team success – are well worth the effort.
