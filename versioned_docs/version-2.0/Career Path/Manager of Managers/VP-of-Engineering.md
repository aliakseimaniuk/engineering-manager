# VP Of Engineering

For two decades I’ve watched engineers grow, stumble, and ultimately thrive. And one role consistently feels…different. It’s not the most *technically* challenging, nor the one with the loudest accolades. It’s the VP of Engineering. Many engineers aspire to it, assuming it's simply “more of the same” – more team, more scope, more responsibility. That’s…partially true. But it’s the *nature* of that increased responsibility that separates a good engineering manager from a truly effective VP.

This isn’t about becoming a better coder, though a strong technical foundation is *essential*. This is about a fundamental shift in your operating system – moving from *building* the thing to *enabling* the builders. Here's what it really takes to make that leap.

## The Shift in Perspective: From Deep Work to System Design

Early in your career, success is defined by *output*. You deliver features, fix bugs, write elegant code. As you move into management, success is measured by *team output*. You focus on process, unblocking your team, and keeping projects on track. 

Becoming a VP shifts *again*. Now, your primary goal isn't *what* gets built, but *how* the engineering organization itself operates. You're responsible for the *system* of engineering: the people, the processes, the culture, and the tools. Think of it like this: you're no longer designing a single feature; you’re architecting the entire platform for *all* features.

I remember early in my career, obsessing over a particularly tricky bug fix. It consumed me for a weekend. As a VP, that same situation would require me to ask: "What systemic issue allowed this bug to reach production? What processes need improvement? What training do our engineers need?" The focus shifts from *solving* the problem to *preventing* it.

## The Core Competencies: Beyond Technical Prowess

Technical skill is a baseline requirement. A VP of Engineering *needs* to understand the technical landscape, but their core competencies lie elsewhere. Let's break down what those are:

* **Strategic Thinking:** You need to translate the company’s vision into an engineering roadmap. This isn't about knowing *how* to build everything; it's about prioritizing *what* to build and *when*. This requires a strong understanding of the market, the customer, and the competitive landscape.
* **Organizational Design:** Building a scalable and effective engineering organization is critical. This includes defining team structures, roles, and responsibilities.  It’s understanding the trade-offs between centralization and decentralization, and adapting the organization as the company grows.
* **People Leadership (at Scale):**  You’re not just managing a team of 5-10 engineers. You're leading leaders. This means building a culture of trust, empowerment, and continuous learning. It also means being a champion for your engineers, advocating for their needs, and helping them grow in their careers.
* **Communication & Influence:**  You'll be interacting with stakeholders across the entire company, from product and sales to marketing and finance.  You need to be able to articulate technical concepts in a clear and concise manner, and to influence decisions that impact the engineering organization.
* **Financial Acumen:** Engineering organizations consume significant resources. Understanding budgets, forecasting costs, and demonstrating ROI are critical skills for a VP of Engineering.  Specifically, VPs should be comfortable with metrics like burn rate, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Lifetime Value (LTV).

## Fighting Entropy: The Proactive VP

As Barry Boehm articulates in *Empirical Software Engineering*, all systems naturally degrade over time – a phenomenon known as software entropy. A VP of Engineering isn’t just building new things; they’re actively fighting against that entropy. This isn't merely about preventing bugs; it’s about the long-term health and sustainability of the entire system.

This means:

* **Investing in Tech Debt Reduction:** It’s easy to push tech debt down the line, but a proactive VP recognizes the long-term cost of doing so – increased maintenance costs, slower development velocity, and decreased employee morale.
* **Automating Processes:**  Reducing manual effort and improving efficiency are key to scaling the engineering organization.
* **Standardizing Tools & Technologies:**  While innovation is important, a consistent tech stack simplifies development, reduces complexity, and improves maintainability.
* **Prioritizing Reliability & Scalability:**  Building a robust and scalable platform is essential for long-term success.

## The Two Types of Process-Focused Engineers

Interestingly, I've observed two distinct types of engineers who take process very seriously. The first are those striving for efficiency and quality. They see process as a means to an end – a way to deliver better software faster. The second genuinely *love* the process itself. While not inherently bad, this can sometimes lead to over-engineering and bureaucracy. As a VP, you need to be able to distinguish between these two approaches. Those focused on outcomes will readily adapt a process if it's hindering delivery, while those who love the process will often defend it regardless of its impact. Fostering a culture that prioritizes outcomes over process is key. 

## Final Thoughts

Becoming a VP of Engineering isn't just about climbing the ladder. It's about embracing a new mindset, developing new skills, and taking on a new level of responsibility. It's about moving beyond the code and focusing on building a high-performing engineering organization that can deliver innovative products and drive business growth.  It’s about proactively fighting entropy and creating a sustainable system for building great software – not just today, but for years to come. 

What is one area where you can start shifting your focus from *building* to *enabling*?
