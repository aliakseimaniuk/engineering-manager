# CEO

For many of us in engineering management, the CEO feels…distant. A figurehead in all-hands meetings, a name on company-wide emails, someone whose strategic decisions impact our teams but rarely involves direct, day-to-day interaction. It’s easy to fall into the trap of viewing the CEO as simply “the boss’s boss.” But a truly effective engineering leader understands *what* the CEO does, *why* they do it, and, crucially, *how to navigate that relationship* for the benefit of their team and the company. This isn’t about aspiring to *be* the CEO, but about becoming a better leader *by understanding* their priorities and challenges. 

## The CEO's Core Responsibilities: Beyond Vision & Strategy

We often hear about the CEO’s responsibility for “vision” and “strategy.” Those are critical, absolutely. But those high-level concepts translate into very specific, demanding tasks. Here’s a breakdown of what a CEO *actually* spends their time doing:

* **Capital Allocation:** This is arguably the *most* important thing a CEO does. Where does the company invest its resources – R&D, sales & marketing, acquisitions, infrastructure? Every dollar spent (or *not* spent) is a decision with long-term consequences.
* **Risk Management:** Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks – financial, legal, competitive, reputational – is a constant burden. A single misstep can be catastrophic. (Consider the WorldCom scandal – inflated earnings to avoid a takeover bid – a risk that ultimately destroyed the company.)
* **Stakeholder Management:** Balancing the needs and expectations of investors, employees, customers, partners, and the board is a constant tightrope walk.
* **Talent Acquisition & Retention (at the Executive Level):** While HR handles the majority of hiring, the CEO is ultimately responsible for building and maintaining a strong executive team.
* **External Representation:** Being the face of the company to the public, the media, and potential partners.

Understanding *these* responsibilities—the constant pressure, the long hours spent wrestling with incredibly complex problems—provides crucial context. The CEO isn't just dreaming up cool features; they're wrestling with the survival of the company.

## How This Impacts *You* as an Engineering Manager

So, what does all this mean for you? Several things:

* **Prioritization Requires Context:** When you’re competing for resources, understanding the CEO's priorities is essential. Is the company focused on growth, profitability, or market share? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) the CEO is laser-focused on? Knowing this will help you frame your requests and justify your team's work.
* **Transparency is Key:** Don't just present *what* your team is building; explain *why* it matters to the company's overall goals. Connect your technical work to the KPIs the CEO cares about. "We're reducing latency by 20%" is good. A stronger approach would be: "Reducing latency by 20% will improve user engagement, driving a projected 5% increase in revenue."
* **Manage Expectations Realistically:** Avoid overpromising and underdelivering. The CEO needs to trust that you're providing honest assessments of your team's capacity and timelines. A reputation for accuracy is invaluable.
* **Be Proactive About Risk:** Don’t wait for problems to surface. Flag potential technical risks and suggest mitigation strategies. This demonstrates leadership and builds trust.
* **Think Beyond the Immediate Task:** The CEO is thinking years ahead. While your team is focused on the current sprint, consider the long-term implications of your technical decisions. Scalability, maintainability, and security are critical.

## Learning from the Past: Antioco & Keyes at Blockbuster

The story of Blockbuster provides a stark illustration of this dynamic. John Antioco, the CEO who spearheaded the company’s foray into online rentals, understood the shifting landscape. However, he faced resistance from the board, who were heavily invested in protecting the existing brick-and-mortar business and its short-term profits. When Antioco was replaced by Jim Keyes, a retail specialist, the company doubled down on its physical stores, ultimately missing the opportunity to become a dominant player in the streaming market.

This wasn’t simply a bad strategic decision; it was a failure of *aligned understanding*. The board, focused on preserving the current business model, lacked a full appreciation for the speed and magnitude of the disruption occurring in the market. Antioco’s attempts to communicate the long-term threat were dismissed as overly risky. Keyes, while a strong retail operator, lacked the vision to embrace the necessary transformation. This misalignment between perspectives at the executive and board levels directly impacted the company’s ability to adapt and ultimately led to its decline. 

## Building a Bridge: Proactive Communication & Relationship Building

You don't need to become best friends with the CEO. But proactively building a professional relationship can be incredibly beneficial. 

* **Seek out opportunities to present your team's work directly to the CEO (or their direct reports).**
* **Attend company-wide events and engage in conversations.**
* **Be a thought leader – share your insights and perspectives.**

The goal isn’t to curry favor, but to demonstrate your commitment to the company’s success and your ability to contribute at a strategic level.


**In conclusion:** Understanding the CEO’s role isn’t about aspiring to their position. It’s about becoming a more effective engineering leader by appreciating the broader business context, proactively managing expectations, and building a strong relationship based on trust and transparency.  Start a conversation with your stakeholders to better align priorities and ensure your team’s work directly contributes to the company’s overall success.
