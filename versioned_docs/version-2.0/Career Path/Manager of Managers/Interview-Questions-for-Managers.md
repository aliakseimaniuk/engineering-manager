# Interview Questions For Managers

For years, I’ve sat on both sides of the interview table – as a candidate and, more frequently, as the person doing the hiring. Early in my career, I fell into the trap of asking the standard “tell me about yourself,” “what are your strengths and weaknesses,” and “where do you see yourself in five years?” While those questions aren't *bad*, they rarely reveal what *really* matters when evaluating a candidate for a management role. 

How many times have you hired a technically brilliant engineer, only to discover they struggle to lead a team? Technical prowess is important, but effective engineering management isn't about being the best coder; it’s about building high-performing teams, navigating complex technical decisions, and fostering a culture of growth. 

This post dives into the types of interview questions I now prioritize – questions designed to unearth a candidate’s genuine managerial capabilities. These aren't trick questions; they're behavioral and situational prompts that reveal *how* a candidate thinks, acts, and leads.

**Why Standard Questions Fall Short**

Let’s be honest: most candidates are prepared for the typical interview questions. They've rehearsed their answers, often providing what they *believe* the interviewer wants to hear. This leads to polished but often superficial responses. We need to dig deeper. I was recently reading *The High Growth Handbook* by Elad Gil, a well-known investor and advisor to high-growth companies, and a key takeaway was the importance of asking the *right* questions, particularly when scaling a team. He emphasizes that a lack of answers to critical questions will lead to "bad luck" – essentially, avoidable failures. The same principle applies to hiring managers.

**The Core Areas to Probe**

Before diving into specific questions, let’s categorize the managerial skills we’re assessing:

* **Conflict Resolution:** Proactively seeks to understand different perspectives and mediate disagreements.
* **Technical Decision-Making:**  Balances trade-offs, considers risks, and clearly articulates reasoning.
* **Delegation & Empowerment:**  Trusts team members, provides support, and encourages growth.
* **Growth & Development:**  Invests in team members' professional development and provides constructive feedback.
* **Ownership & Accountability:**  Takes responsibility for both successes and failures and learns from mistakes.



**Actionable Interview Questions (and what to listen for)**

Here's a breakdown of questions, categorized by the area they assess, along with indicators of strong, weak, and potential red flag responses.

**1. Conflict Resolution: "Tell me about a time when two members of your team had a significant disagreement. How did you handle it?"**

* **Strong Response:**  The candidate describes actively listening to both sides, facilitating a constructive conversation, and focusing on the problem, not personalities. They'll likely mention guiding the team towards a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Weak Response:**  The candidate takes sides, avoids the conflict altogether, or describes a heavy-handed approach. Look out for blaming individuals rather than addressing the underlying issue.
* **Potential Red Flag:** The candidate describes immediately resolving the conflict themselves without involving the team members. This suggests a lack of trust in their team’s ability to self-manage.

**2. Technical Decision-Making: "Describe a time when you had to make a critical technical decision with incomplete information. What factors did you consider, and what was the outcome?"**

* **Strong Response:** The candidate clearly articulates the trade-offs involved, demonstrates a methodical approach to evaluating options (e.g., cost, time, risk), and acknowledges any uncertainties. They should be able to explain *why* they made the decision they did.
* **Weak Response:**  The candidate glosses over the complexities, relies on gut feeling, or struggles to explain their reasoning.  A strong manager understands the importance of transparency in technical choices.
* **Potential Red Flag:** The candidate focuses solely on the technical aspects and fails to mention any consideration for business impact or user experience.

**3. Delegation & Empowerment: “Imagine you have a new engineer on your team who is eager to take on more responsibility, but is still relatively inexperienced. What would you do to help them grow?”**

* **Strong Response:**  The candidate describes a deliberate approach to delegation, starting with smaller, well-defined tasks, providing clear expectations, and offering ongoing support and mentorship.  They emphasize giving the engineer the *opportunity* to learn and grow, even if it means accepting some initial mistakes.
* **Weak Response:**  The candidate defaults to doing the work themselves, expresses a lack of trust in the engineer’s abilities, or focuses solely on avoiding errors. 
* **Potential Red Flag:** The candidate suggests assigning the engineer a task without providing any guidance or support.

**4. Growth & Development: “Tell me about a time you had to deliver difficult feedback to a team member. How did you approach it, and what was the result?”**

* **Strong Response:** The candidate emphasizes a focus on specific behaviors, providing constructive criticism with empathy and offering suggestions for improvement.  They’ll likely describe a conversation focused on growth, not blame.
* **Weak Response:**  The candidate avoids giving feedback altogether, delivers criticism harshly, or focuses on personality traits rather than behaviors.
* **Potential Red Flag:** The candidate describes delivering feedback in public or without considering the team member’s feelings.

**5. Ownership & Accountability: “Describe a project that didn’t go as planned. What was your role in it, and what did you learn from the experience?”**

* **Strong Response:**  The candidate takes ownership of their role in the failure, identifies specific lessons learned, and demonstrates a commitment to preventing similar mistakes in the future.  This is *crucial* – look for humility and a willingness to learn.
* **Weak Response:**  The candidate blames others, downplays their own role, or fails to identify any meaningful lessons learned.
* **Potential Red Flag:** The candidate describes the failure without taking any responsibility or offering any suggestions for improvement.



**Going Beyond Questions: Behavioral Interviewing Best Practices**

* **Follow-up Questions are Key:** Don’t just accept the initial response. Dig deeper with "Tell me more about that," or "What was your thinking behind that decision?"
* **The STAR Method:** Encourage candidates to answer using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to provide concrete examples. This provides context and allows you to assess the situation thoroughly.
* **Listen Actively:** Pay attention not only to *what* the candidate says, but *how* they say it.  Are they thoughtful, articulate, and empathetic? Holistic assessment is about looking at the whole picture.

**Final Thoughts**

Hiring an engineering manager is a critical investment. By asking the right questions and actively listening to the responses, you can identify candidates who possess the skills, experience, and leadership qualities to build high-performing teams and drive your organization forward.  Remember, technical skills are important, but leadership is what ultimately unlocks potential.
