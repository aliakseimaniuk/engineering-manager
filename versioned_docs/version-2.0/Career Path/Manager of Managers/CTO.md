# CTO

For many engineers, the CTO role represents the pinnacle of their career. It’s a seat at the table, a chance to shape technology direction, and a position of significant influence. But the reality of being a CTO today is often vastly different from the expectations. I’ve seen this play out countless times over my 20+ years in software engineering and leadership, both in fast-moving startups and within larger organizations. This isn't just about being a great engineer anymore; it’s about *leading* technology within a complex business landscape. Let's unpack the evolving role of the CTO and what it takes to succeed.

## The Traditional View: The “Chief Techie”

Historically, the CTO was primarily a highly skilled architect. They were the deepest technical mind in the room, responsible for choosing the right technologies, ensuring scalability, and solving the most challenging engineering problems. This “Chief Techie” model worked reasonably well in the early days of many tech companies, when the biggest challenge was simply *building* something. Think of the early days of many web startups – the CTO was often hands-on, coding alongside the team, and making critical architectural decisions. 

However, even then, this model had limitations. A purely technical focus often meant the CTO was disconnected from the business realities – understanding market needs, revenue streams, and competitive pressures. This disconnect could lead to building technically brilliant solutions that didn’t address actual customer problems or align with the company’s strategic goals.

## The Modern CTO: A Strategic Business Leader First

Today, the role demands a significant shift. The modern CTO must be a strategic business leader *first*, and a technical expert second. This isn’t to say technical depth is no longer important – it’s still crucial for credibility and informed decision-making. But the bulk of the CTO’s time should be spent on:

* **Vision & Strategy:** Defining the long-term technology vision for the company, aligning it with the overall business strategy, and anticipating future trends.
* **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Working closely with product, marketing, sales, and finance to understand their needs and ensure technology supports their goals. This is *essential*. I’ve seen countless projects fail because engineering operated in a silo, building things nobody wanted or couldn’t effectively sell. For example, at one company, a lack of collaboration between engineering and sales resulted in a complex feature that addressed a niche customer need, but the sales team hadn't been trained on how to position it, leading to low adoption.
* **Team Leadership & Development:** Building, mentoring, and motivating a high-performing engineering team. This includes attracting top talent, fostering a culture of innovation, and providing opportunities for growth.
* **Innovation & Experimentation:** Driving innovation through experimentation, research, and exploration of new technologies.
* **Budget & Resource Allocation:** Making smart decisions about how to allocate limited resources to maximize impact.

Think about Voyager Digital. [https://www.voyagerdigital.com/](https://www.voyagerdigital.com/) Founded in 2018, its initial CTO likely focused on building a crypto asset trading platform. But as the company evolved, and faced financial difficulties, the need shifted. The appointment of a retail specialist CEO signals a change in strategic direction, requiring the CTO to potentially overhaul the technology to support a different business model – perhaps integrating more with POS systems for in-store experiences, or streamlining operations for cost efficiency. This requires a fundamental shift in priorities and technological roadmap.

## The "Shape" of a Modern CTO: Skills & Traits

So, what skills and traits define the successful modern CTO? Here’s what I’ve observed:

* **Strong Communication Skills:** The ability to explain complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences is paramount.
* **Business Acumen:** Understanding key business metrics, market dynamics, and competitive landscapes is essential.
* **Strategic Thinking:** The ability to see the big picture and anticipate future trends.
* **Leadership & Emotional Intelligence:** The ability to motivate and inspire a team.
* **Risk Management:** Assessing and mitigating technical and business risks.
* **Adaptability:** Being able to navigate change and uncertainty.


## Navigating the Path to Becoming a CTO

For engineers aspiring to become CTOs, here’s some advice:

* **Broaden Your Skillset:** Don’t just focus on technical expertise. Seek out opportunities to learn about business, product management, and marketing.
* **Lead Without Authority:** Take on leadership roles within your team or organization, even if you don't have formal authority. 
* **Develop Your Communication Skills:** Practice explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences. 
* **Seek Mentorship:** Find a seasoned leader who can provide guidance and support.
* **Understand the Business:** Learn how your company makes money and what drives its success.

Many engineers find the shift to strategic leadership challenging, requiring a conscious effort to develop new skills and perspectives. 

The CTO role is no longer simply about being a brilliant engineer. It’s about being a strategic leader who can bridge the gap between technology and business, drive innovation, and build a high-performing team. By embracing this broader perspective, aspiring CTOs can position themselves for success and make a lasting impact on their organizations. 

**Challenge:** Over the next month, identify one area where you can improve your cross-functional collaboration. Schedule a meeting with someone outside of engineering to understand their challenges and needs.

Looking ahead, the CTO role is likely to become even more externally focused, requiring a deep understanding of emerging technologies impacting the *entire* industry and a focus on building platforms that enable innovation rather than building everything in-house.
