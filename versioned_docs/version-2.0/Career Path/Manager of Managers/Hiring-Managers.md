# Hiring Managers

For two decades, I’ve been building and leading engineering teams. I’ve hired hundreds of engineers, and, crucially, I’ve hired *other* managers. And let me tell you, hiring the latter is a completely different beast. We’re so often focused on technical prowess when building teams, but when it comes to management, technical skills are only table stakes. The *real* challenge is identifying individuals who genuinely understand and can *execute* effective management – not just those who *want* the title.

I recently spoke with an engineering director who shared her frustration: “We keep promoting technically brilliant engineers into management, and they’re *terrible* with people. Morale is down, and projects are stalled.” This sentiment, unfortunately, is all too common. It highlights a painful truth – too many people are *promoted* into management roles without the fundamental skills or, frankly, the *inclination* to actually lead and support a team. It’s a sentiment echoed by so many engineers I’ve spoken with (“I wish my managers cared about their employees the way you do”). This isn’t about being a "softie"; it’s about recognizing that motivated, supported employees are *more productive*, *more innovative*, and *more loyal*.

This article isn’t about finding the perfect manager. It's about shifting *how* we evaluate candidates, focusing on the less-tangible, but vastly more important, aspects of management aptitude. Here's what I look for, and how I try to uncover it during the interview process.

## 1. Beyond the Resume: Focus on Demonstrated Leadership, Not Just Technical Achievement

It's easy to get dazzled by a candidate’s technical accomplishments. But a brilliant engineer doesn’t automatically become a great manager. I actively *de-emphasize* purely technical details in the initial screening. Instead, I look for demonstrable *leadership* experience. This isn’t necessarily about formal leadership roles (though that's a plus). It's about *how* they’ve influenced others. 

**How to uncover it:**

*   **Behavioral Questions Focused on Influence:** Instead of "Tell me about a challenging project," try "Tell me about a time you had to convince a team to adopt a different approach. How did you handle resistance?" or “Describe a time you had to deliver difficult feedback.” 
*   **Look for "We" Not Just "I":** Pay attention to their language. Are they framing accomplishments as individual achievements ("I built this feature…") or as team efforts ("We overcame this challenge…")?
*   **Probe for Mentorship:** “Have you ever mentored or coached someone? What was your approach, and what did you learn?” This reveals their willingness to invest in others.

## 2. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence: The Often-Missed Ingredient

A harsh, yet commonly voiced, sentiment is that “no manager, anywhere, cares about his subordinates.” While cynical, it underscores the importance of genuine care as a foundational management skill. It's not weakness; it’s a critical capability. A manager with high emotional intelligence understands that each team member is a unique individual with their own motivations, challenges, and career goals. They create a safe space for open communication, feedback, and growth.

**How to uncover it:**

*   **Situational Questions with a "People" Focus:** "Imagine a team member is consistently missing deadlines. How would you approach the situation?" Listen for empathy, curiosity, and a focus on understanding the *root cause* of the problem, not just assigning blame.
*   **Ask About Handling Conflict:** “Describe a time you had to mediate a conflict between team members. What was your approach, and what did you learn?” 
*   **Look for Self-Awareness:** Ask something like, “What’s one thing you’re actively working on to improve as a leader?” Self-awareness is a key indicator of emotional intelligence.

## 3. Strategic Thinking & Delegation (Not Just "Doing")

Too many newly-promoted managers succumb to the temptation of doing the work themselves, rather than *enabling* their team to do it. This is a fast track to burnout and a disengaged team. A strong manager understands the importance of delegation, prioritization, and strategic thinking. They can see the bigger picture and help their team align their efforts accordingly.

**How to uncover it:**

*   **Scenario-Based Questions:** "You have a critical project with a tight deadline, and your team is already overloaded. How would you approach prioritizing tasks and allocating resources?"
*   **Ask About Delegation Style:** "Describe your approach to delegation. What factors do you consider when assigning tasks?"
*   **Probe for Long-Term Vision:** "How do you approach career development for your team members?" A good manager is invested in the long-term growth of their team.

## The "Invisible" Skill: Creating a Culture of Trust

I recently read something that resonated with me: “He created management, like bringing into existence something from that which is invisible.” That "something invisible" is *trust*. A truly effective manager builds a culture of trust within their team, where people feel safe to take risks, share ideas, and challenge the status quo. This is not something you can easily measure on a resume, but it’s arguably the most important skill of all. 

**How to assess (it's subtle):**

*   **Pay attention to *how* they talk about previous teams:** Do they speak with respect and admiration, or do they focus on weaknesses and shortcomings? For example, a candidate who consistently blames former team members or dismisses their contributions is a red flag. Conversely, someone who highlights team successes and acknowledges individual contributions demonstrates a positive and respectful approach.
*   **Look for a genuine curiosity about people:** Do they ask questions about your team and your company culture? This indicates they value understanding the people they’ll be leading.
*   **Trust your gut:** Does this person feel like someone you would want to work for?

**Final Thoughts**

Hiring another manager is a high-stakes decision. Don’t settle for someone who *appears* qualified on paper. Focus on the qualities that truly matter: empathy, strategic thinking, and the ability to build a culture of trust. Remember, you’re not just hiring someone to manage tasks; you’re hiring someone to lead and inspire a team.

The next time you’re evaluating candidates for a management role, remember to look beyond technical skills and prioritize these crucial qualities. Your team—and your bottom line—will thank you.
