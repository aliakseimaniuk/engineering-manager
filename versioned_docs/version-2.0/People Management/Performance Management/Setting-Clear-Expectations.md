# Setting Clear Expectations

As engineering managers, we often talk about technical debt, sprint velocity, and architectural patterns. But there’s a different kind of debt that can cripple a team faster than any bug – the debt of *unclear expectations*. Studies show that miscommunication costs organizations an average of $11,000 per employee per year. This isn’t just about lost productivity; it’s about eroding morale, breeding frustration, and ultimately hindering high performance. Over two decades leading engineering teams, I’ve learned that consistently setting – and *revisiting* – clear expectations isn't just a “nice to have”; it’s the bedrock of trust, psychological safety, and ultimately, high performance.

## The Cost of Ambiguity

Frustration at work often stems from not knowing *what* is expected, *how* your work will be evaluated, or *why* you're doing something. This isn’t about being “told what to do”; it’s about understanding the *context* and *purpose* behind the work. 

I remember leading a team building a new feature for a mobile app. I outlined the technical requirements, but failed to explicitly state *how* we’d measure success. The team delivered a technically sound feature, but it didn’t move the needle on the key metric we were hoping to impact – user engagement. The team felt deflated, and I realized my mistake: I’d focused on *what* needed to be built, neglecting *why* and *how* we'd know if it was *successful*. 

This scenario isn’t unique. Lehtinen et al. (2015) highlight how a disconnect between development outcomes and product owner expectations frequently stems from a lack of shared understanding from the beginning. Their research demonstrates that proactively defining success metrics *collaboratively* significantly improves project outcomes. And in the fast-paced world of software development, assuming alignment is a dangerous gamble.

## Beyond Tasks: Defining Expectations Across Multiple Dimensions

Setting clear expectations isn’t just about assigning tasks. It needs to be holistic, encompassing several key areas:

* **Outcome Expectations:** What are we trying to achieve? What does "done" look like? This isn't just a checklist of features; it's tying work back to business goals and user needs. Use the “SMART” framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to define these effectively.
* **Process Expectations:** How should work be approached? What coding standards, testing procedures, or communication channels should be used? Document these clearly and make them easily accessible.
* **Behavioral Expectations:** How should team members interact with each other? What are the norms around code review, feedback, and conflict resolution? This is where you define the team's operating principles and foster psychological safety. Clear behavioral expectations create a safe space for vulnerability and open communication.
* **Performance Expectations:** How will individual contributions be evaluated? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs)? Be transparent about how performance impacts career growth.

## Proactive Communication: A Holistic Approach

Setting expectations isn't a one-time event. It requires ongoing, proactive communication – a consistent investment in shared understanding. Rather than simply listing tactics, view communication as a holistic approach to expectation management. Here’s what I’ve found to be effective:

* **Regular 1:1s:** Use these meetings to discuss individual goals, progress, and any roadblocks. Ask clarifying questions like, "What are your top priorities for this week?" or "How do you see your work contributing to the larger project goals?"
* **Sprint Planning & Refinement:** Don't just assign tasks; discuss the *why* behind them and ensure everyone understands the expected outcome. Encourage questions and challenge assumptions.
* **Feedback Loops:** Provide regular, constructive feedback. Be specific and focus on behavior, not personality. Encourage team members to do the same for each other.
* **Document Everything:** Use a shared document (wiki, Confluence, Google Docs) to record expectations, decisions, and key information. This creates a single source of truth and reduces the risk of miscommunication.



## Addressing the Optimism Bias & Managing Unmet Expectations

As the opening lines suggest, there's often inherent optimism at the start of any project. People tend to underestimate the complexity and overestimate their ability to deliver. It’s our job as leaders to gently ground these expectations in reality. This isn’t about being negative; it’s about being honest. Proactive risk identification, as emphasized by McConnell, is crucial. 

But what happens when, despite our best efforts, expectations aren’t met? It’s vital to address these situations with empathy and a focus on learning.  Instead of blame, focus on understanding *why* the expectation wasn’t met – was it unrealistic, poorly communicated, or were there unforeseen challenges? A post-mortem analysis, conducted with a growth mindset, can transform setbacks into valuable learning opportunities.

## The Payoff: Trust and Empowerment

When expectations are clear, team members feel more confident, empowered, and motivated. They understand what’s expected of them, how their work contributes to the bigger picture, and how their performance will be evaluated. This fosters a culture of trust, accountability, and psychological safety. 

As Henry Hazlitt points out in *Economics in One Lesson*, understanding the long-term consequences of our actions is vital. Investing in clear expectations isn’t just about improving short-term productivity; it’s about building a sustainable, high-performing team that can thrive in the face of challenges. 

It takes effort, consistent communication, and a willingness to address ambiguity head-on. **Start this week by documenting your team’s behavioral expectations and discussing them in your next team meeting. Encourage open dialogue and create a shared understanding of how you’ll work together.** The payoff – a team that’s aligned, motivated, and empowered – is well worth the investment.
