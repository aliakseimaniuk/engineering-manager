# Coaching For Performance

What separates good engineering teams from *great* ones? Often, it’s not just technical skill, but how leaders help individuals grow. For two decades, I’ve seen firsthand how empowered teams can achieve incredible things, and conversely, how potential can be stifled when growth is overlooked. We often talk about “giving feedback,” but true impact comes from actively *coaching* for performance. This isn’t a soft skill; it's a core competency for any effective engineering manager.

Too often, performance conversations feel like post-mortems focused on *what* went wrong. While addressing issues is crucial, consistently focusing solely on problems neglects the biggest opportunity: unlocking potential. Coaching shifts the focus from simply *telling* someone what to do to *empowering* them to figure it out, build confidence, and improve sustainably.

## The Coaching-Feedback Distinction

Let's be clear: feedback *has* its place. Direct, constructive feedback is vital for correcting course quickly. But it's transactional. You identify a gap, point it out, and expect correction. Coaching, on the other hand, is relational and developmental. It's about understanding an individual's goals, identifying obstacles, and collaboratively exploring solutions.

Think of it this way:

* **Feedback:** "The integration tests failed because you didn't mock the database connection." (Problem-focused, directive)
* **Coaching:** “I noticed the integration tests failed. What challenges did you encounter while setting up the tests? What could we do differently next time to ensure they pass consistently?” (Goal-focused, exploratory)

See the difference? The second approach invites dialogue, fosters learning, and builds ownership.

## A Simple Coaching Framework: GROW

I’ve found the GROW model incredibly useful in structuring coaching conversations. Developed by Sir John Whitmore, it’s simple, adaptable, and keeps the conversation focused and productive.

* **G – Goal:** What does the individual want to achieve? Be specific. This isn’t about company objectives; it's about *their* personal and professional aspirations within the context of their work. “I want to become more comfortable leading technical design discussions” is far more impactful than simply “improve my communication skills.”
* **R – Reality:** What is the current situation?  Honest self-assessment is key.  Ask questions like, “What’s working well?” and “What’s holding you back?”  This is about understanding the gaps between their aspirations and their current performance. Resist the urge to jump in with your own assessment; let them articulate their perspective.
* **O – Options:** What are the possible paths forward? Brainstorm solutions *together*. Encourage creativity and don't immediately dismiss ideas. The goal is to generate a range of options, not to find the perfect solution right away.
* **W – Will/Way Forward:** What specific actions will the individual take?  This is where the conversation becomes concrete.  Help them define measurable steps with clear timelines.  "I will volunteer to lead the next design discussion for Feature X, and I’ll ask Sarah for feedback afterward" is a much stronger commitment than simply "I’ll work on leading more discussions."

## Key Coaching Habits & Practices

Effective coaching requires more than just a framework. It's about consistently applying certain habits in your interactions with your team:

**Active Listening:** Truly hear what your team members are saying—both the words and the underlying emotions.  Paraphrase to confirm understanding, and ask clarifying questions. I often encourage managers to practice “listening to understand, not to respond.”

**Powerful Questioning:** Don't give answers; ask questions that encourage self-reflection and problem-solving. "What have you tried so far?" "What are the potential consequences of each option?" "What support do you need from me?"

**Empathy and Curiosity:** Approach each conversation with genuine curiosity and a desire to understand the individual's perspective. Assume positive intent.

**Focus on Strengths:** While addressing areas for improvement is important, also acknowledge and build upon existing strengths. This fosters confidence and motivation.

**Regular Check-ins:** Don't wait for formal performance reviews to have coaching conversations. Schedule regular one-on-ones dedicated to growth and development.

## Shifting From "Doing" to "Developing"

It’s easy to fall into the trap of being a solver – jumping in to fix problems and keep things moving. But constantly doing *for* your team prevents them from growing and developing their own skills.  

I remember a junior engineer, David, who consistently struggled with estimating task durations. My initial instinct was to help him break down tasks and provide more realistic timelines. Instead, I started asking him questions: "What assumptions did you make when estimating this task?" "What potential roadblocks do you foresee?" "What data can you use to refine your estimate?" It took longer initially, but David quickly learned to anticipate challenges and provide more accurate estimates. He wasn’t just completing tasks; he was developing a valuable skill. While this approach worked well for David, adapting to individual learning styles is crucial.

## Final Thoughts

Coaching isn’t about being a therapist or a mentor. It’s about creating a supportive environment where engineers can learn, grow, and reach their full potential. It requires intentionality, active listening, and a mindset shift – from “doing” to “developing.”  It’s also important to acknowledge that coaching initially requires more time and effort than simply *telling* someone what to do. However, the long-term benefits – a more engaged, empowered, and skilled team – are well worth the investment. Start by scheduling a dedicated coaching conversation with one team member this week.
