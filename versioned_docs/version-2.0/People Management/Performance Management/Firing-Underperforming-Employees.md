# Firing Underperforming Employees

A high-performing engineering team is the lifeblood of any successful company. But sometimes, even the most talented teams are held back by underperformance. Knowing how to address this – with courage and compassion – is a critical skill for any engineering leader. 

Firing someone is *never* easy. It’s a deeply human act with real consequences, and one that many engineering managers understandably hesitate to address. But avoiding difficult conversations and clinging to underperforming employees isn’t kindness. It’s a disservice – to the individual, to the team, and ultimately, to the company. After 20 years in this field, including being employee #39 at a rapidly scaling startup, I've learned that sometimes, the most compassionate thing you can do as a leader is to help someone move on.

This isn't about being ruthless. It's about understanding that holding onto someone who isn’t a fit, or who isn’t meeting expectations, creates a ripple effect of negativity that erodes team morale, hinders progress, and even impacts the career trajectories of *other* high performers. 

**The Cost of Inaction: Beyond Lost Productivity**

We often focus on the lost productivity of an underperforming employee. That’s a valid concern, of course. But the hidden costs are often far greater:

* **Morale Drain:** High performers quickly become frustrated when they constantly have to pick up the slack or compensate for someone else’s shortcomings. This breeds resentment and can lead *them* to disengage or even leave.
* **Blocked Growth:**  Underperformance often stifles innovation. When a team is constantly firefighting, there’s little time or energy for exploration and growth.
* **Erosion of Standards:**  When underperformance is tolerated, it subtly lowers the bar for everyone.  What was once considered unacceptable becomes normalized.
* **Disengagement & Boredom:**  Sometimes, underperformance isn't about a lack of skill, but a lack of *fit*.  Employees who are bored or unchallenged often become disengaged, leading to reduced productivity and a drain on team morale. This mismatch can be a critical signal that a different role—perhaps even outside the company—would be a better fit.



**A Framework for Compassionate Termination**

Firing isn’t an event; it’s the culmination of a process. Here's a framework I’ve used successfully:

1. **Early and Frequent Feedback:**  This isn’t about waiting for the annual performance review to address issues. It’s about providing *ongoing* constructive criticism and support. Regular 1:1s are critical. Be specific, actionable, and focus on behavior, not personality.  “The recent API integration had several bugs that required significant rework. Let’s discuss how we can improve code review processes and unit test coverage going forward” is far more effective than "Your code quality needs improvement."
2. **Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** If feedback isn’t leading to improvement, a PIP is essential. This should clearly outline:
    * **Specific Areas for Improvement:** Be precise.
    * **Measurable Goals:** How will success be defined?
    * **Timeline:** How long will the PIP last? (Typically 30-90 days)
    * **Support Provided:**  What resources will you offer to help the employee succeed? (Mentorship, training, etc.)
    * **Consequences of Non-Improvement:** Be transparent about the potential outcome.
    * **Regular Review & Adjustment:** The PIP isn’t set in stone. Regularly review progress and adjust the plan as needed.
3. **Documentation is King:**  Document *everything* – feedback sessions, PIP progress, and any other relevant information. This protects both the employee and the company.
4. **The Termination Conversation:**  This is the hardest part. Be direct, respectful, and empathetic. 
    * **Be direct and transparent about the situation.** Avoid beating around the bush.
    * **Focus on the fit, not the person.** Explain that the role isn’t a good fit for their skills or that their performance hasn’t met expectations despite support.
    * **Keep it brief.**  Avoid getting into a lengthy debate.
    * **Be prepared for their reaction.**  Allow them to express their emotions, but maintain professional boundaries.
5. **Outplacement Support:**  If possible, offer outplacement services to help the individual find a new role. This demonstrates respect and compassion.



**Leadership & The Courage to Cut**

Ultimately, firing underperforming employees isn't about being “evil” or lacking empathy. It’s about having the courage to make difficult decisions that are in the best interests of the team, the company, and – yes – even the individual. Holding on to someone who isn't a fit isn't helping them; it's hindering their potential. 

Remember, a high-performing team isn't built by tolerating mediocrity. It's built by fostering a culture of excellence, providing consistent feedback, and having the courage to make tough calls. Tolerating underperformance can have serious consequences; covering it up can be even more damaging.  

Start by assessing your team. Identify any potential performance issues and proactively begin having honest, constructive conversations. Remember, addressing underperformance isn’t about being ruthless; it’s about building a thriving team where everyone can succeed.
