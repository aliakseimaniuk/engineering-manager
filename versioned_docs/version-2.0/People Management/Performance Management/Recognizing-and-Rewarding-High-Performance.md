# Recognizing And Rewarding High Performance

For over two decades, I’ve had the privilege of leading engineering teams. And in those years, I’ve seen a recurring pattern – a slow, insidious drain on motivation that stems not from *lack* of reward, but from *misdirected* reward. It’s a particularly tricky problem because it often manifests as declining performance, even in your most capable people. I recently received input from a leader feeling resentful and bored, witnessing a drop in their own performance while observing what felt like rewards for less effective work. This isn’t about entitlement; it’s a fundamental human need for recognition, and when it's consistently misaligned with actual contribution, it's a recipe for disaster.

This isn’t just a ‘people problem’. It’s a *technical* problem. Disengaged engineers make more mistakes, innovate less, and ultimately, deliver lower quality work. So, let’s dig into how to recognize and reward high performance *effectively*, before that quiet erosion sets in. Based on my experience and feedback from other leaders, misaligned rewards are a surprisingly common issue.

## The Problem with Traditional "Rewards"

Too often, "reward" equates to public praise or small perks for *visibility* rather than *impact*. Think about the engineer who’s consistently firefighting production issues. They might get lauded for being a “problem solver” (and the company might even *expect* them to be in firefighting mode), while the engineer who proactively refactors code to *prevent* those issues goes largely unnoticed.  

This creates a perverse incentive. It tells the team: “Reactive work is what we value, even if it’s a symptom of underlying issues.” It’s like patching a leaky roof instead of fixing the structural damage.

I saw this firsthand at a startup a few years back. A developer who consistently volunteered to take on impossible deadlines and “save the day” was constantly praised in all-hands meetings. Meanwhile, the architect who painstakingly designed a scalable, maintainable system was quietly building the foundation for future growth, but received little public recognition. Unsurprisingly, the architect started looking for other opportunities. The constant pressure and lack of appreciation finally took its toll.

Consider this matrix when evaluating how your team's contributions are acknowledged.  Prioritize recognizing and valuing work in the "High Impact, Low Visibility" quadrant.

## Beyond Praise: A Multi-Faceted Approach to Recognition

True recognition goes beyond a quick “thank you” or a shout-out in a meeting. It requires a thoughtful, multi-faceted approach.  It's also crucial to proactively prevent situations where the *wrong* behaviors are being valued.

* **Specificity is Key:** Don’t just say “good job.” Explain *why* their work was valuable. “The refactoring you did on the payment service not only improved performance by 20% but also reduced our bug reports by 15%. That's a huge win for our customers and our engineering team.”
* **Tie Rewards to Values:** What does your company *actually* value? If you preach innovation, reward engineers who experiment with new technologies, even if those experiments don’t always succeed. Consider offering dedicated “innovation sprints” or a budget for engineers to pursue side projects. If you prioritize code quality, highlight engineers who champion best practices and code reviews.
* **Provide Growth Opportunities:** The best reward for many engineers is the opportunity to learn and grow. Offer challenging assignments, mentorship opportunities, or funding for training and conferences. This shows you’re invested in their long-term development.
* **Create Space for Deep Work:** Protect your high performers from constant interruptions and context switching. Allow them dedicated time for focused work on complex problems. This demonstrates you value their ability to deliver quality results.
* **Consider Non-Public Recognition:** Sometimes, a private conversation and sincere expression of appreciation can be more meaningful than public praise, especially for introverted team members.

## Addressing Misaligned Rewards

It’s easy for reward systems to inadvertently incentivize the wrong behaviors. To prevent this, lead by example: publicly acknowledge and celebrate contributions that align with your values.  If you observe behaviors being rewarded that don’t reflect your company’s values, address it directly.  Provide constructive feedback to those receiving misplaced rewards, framing it as helping them understand how to truly impact the team and align with long-term goals.  If the problem persists, escalate it to leadership, explaining how misaligned rewards are affecting morale and performance.  Finally, re-evaluate your performance metrics to ensure they accurately reflect *impact*.

## Reviving Your Own Motivation

The leader who provided the initial input is also experiencing burnout and declining performance. That’s a clear sign something is wrong. Recognize that you can't pour from an empty cup, and prioritizing your own well-being isn’t selfish—it’s essential for effectively supporting your team.

It’s often *hard* to prioritize self-care when you're focused on the needs of others. But making time for activities that recharge you, seeking feedback from your team, and reconnecting with your purpose are all crucial steps.

Recognizing and rewarding high performers isn’t just about keeping your team happy; it’s about building a thriving engineering culture where innovation flourishes, quality is prioritized, and everyone feels valued for their contributions. It takes deliberate effort, but the payoff—a motivated, engaged, and high-performing team—is well worth it.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Focus on Impact:** Reward contributions that demonstrably move the needle, not just visibility.
* **Be Specific:** Explain *why* work is valuable, not just that it’s “good.”
* **Align Rewards with Values:** Ensure rewards reinforce the behaviors you want to see.
* **Prioritize Growth:** Invest in your team’s development through challenging assignments and learning opportunities.
* **Don’t Forget Yourself:** Leaders must prioritize their own well-being to effectively support their teams.
