# Adaptability

For two decades, I’ve seen engineering teams tackle challenges ranging from scaling to millions of users to pivoting entirely to new product directions. Throughout my experience, the ability to adapt has consistently distinguished high-performing teams from those that struggle. And as an engineering leader, fostering that adaptability isn’t just *helpful* – it’s arguably your most important job.

We live in a world that demands constant change. New technologies emerge, market conditions shift, and priorities can change on a dime. While many organizations *talk* about agility, true adaptability goes deeper than just adopting a new framework. It’s about building a team equipped not just to *respond* to change, but to *embrace* it.

This isn’t some soft skill fluff. Adaptability directly impacts velocity, quality, and – crucially – team morale. A team that’s constantly caught off guard by change will burn out faster, deliver lower quality work, and struggle to innovate. So, how do you build it? Here's what I've learned:

**1. Understand the Two Sides of Adaptability: Ability *and* Interest**

Adaptability boils down to ability *and* interest. You can train someone to *do* something new, but if they aren’t *motivated* to learn, the change won’t stick. 

* **Ability:** This is the technical skill and cognitive flexibility. Does the team have the foundational knowledge to pick up new technologies? Can individuals comfortably switch between tasks and contexts? This is addressed through training, mentorship, and encouraging a growth mindset (more on that below).
* **Interest:** This is where things get trickier. Interest comes from understanding *why* change is happening, believing in the vision, and feeling safe enough to experiment. This requires transparent communication and fostering a culture of psychological safety (see #4).

**2. Cultivate a Growth Mindset – and Model It Yourself**

Carol Dweck’s work on growth mindset is foundational here.  As Dweck explains in *Mindset: The New Psychology of Success* (2006), a growth mindset – the belief that abilities are not fixed but can be developed through dedication and hard work – is essential for adaptability. 

* **Encourage Learning:** Actively promote learning opportunities – workshops, conferences, online courses, even internal "lunch and learns". And *reward* learning, not just results. Acknowledge and celebrate team members who embrace new challenges.
* **Normalize Failure:** Failure is inevitable. A team afraid to fail won’t take risks or experiment. Frame failures as learning opportunities. Conduct post-mortems that focus on *what* went wrong, not *who* to blame. For example, I once saw a team initially resistant to adopting a new testing framework. After a post-mortem focused on learning from a failed implementation, they embraced the framework and significantly improved code quality.
* **Lead by Example:** This is critical. *You* need to be a lifelong learner. Share your own learning experiences – the things you’re struggling with, the new skills you’re acquiring. Vulnerability fosters trust and encourages others to embrace learning.

**3. Embrace Small Bets and Rapid Experimentation**

Large, sweeping changes are often paralyzing. Instead, encourage a culture of small bets and rapid experimentation. 

* **Decompose Challenges:** Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable chunks.
* **Build-Measure-Learn:** Adopt a Lean Startup approach. Quickly build a minimal viable product (MVP), measure its impact, and learn from the results. This allows the team to iterate quickly and adapt to changing circumstances.  
* **Encourage “Spikes”:** Allow engineers time for exploratory work. “Spikes” – short, focused investigations into new technologies or approaches – can reduce risk and inform future decisions.

**4. Foster Psychological Safety – The Cornerstone of Adaptability**

This is arguably the most important, and often most overlooked, aspect of building an adaptable team. Psychological safety is the belief that you won’t be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. 

* **Encourage Open Communication:** Create a safe space for honest feedback. Actively solicit input from all team members.
* **Listen Actively:** Really listen to what your team members are saying. Avoid interrupting or dismissing their ideas.
* **Model Vulnerability:** Admit your own mistakes. Ask for help when you need it.
* **Celebrate Diverse Perspectives:** A team with diverse backgrounds and perspectives is more likely to identify potential problems and develop innovative solutions.

**Creating a Safe Space:**  Regularly check in with team members individually to understand their concerns.
**Encouraging Feedback:** Implement a system for anonymous feedback if team members are hesitant to speak up in group settings.

**5. Consider the Future of Work**

The trend toward remote and hybrid work is clear. As engineering leaders, we need to prepare for a future where teams are increasingly distributed. This requires adapting how we foster experimentation and psychological safety.

* **Invest in Communication Tools:** Ensure your team has the tools they need to collaborate effectively, regardless of location.
* **Over-Communicate:** In a distributed environment, over-communication is key. Regular check-ins, clear documentation, and transparent decision-making are essential.
* **Focus on Outcomes, Not Hours:** Trust your team to get the job done, regardless of where or when they work.  



Adaptability isn’t a nice-to-have skill—it’s essential for thriving in today’s rapidly changing world. By fostering a growth mindset, encouraging experimentation, prioritizing psychological safety, and preparing for the future of work, you can build a team that doesn’t just *respond* to change, but *embraces* it—and ultimately thrives because of it.  An adaptable team is a resilient team – one that can innovate faster, overcome challenges more effectively, and retain top talent.

**What You Can Do Today:**

*   **Schedule a "Learning Share" Session:** Dedicate 30 minutes in your next team meeting for team members to share something new they've learned.
*   **Lead by Example:** Share a recent challenge *you* faced and what you learned from it.
*   **Ask for Feedback:**  Specifically ask your team what *you* can do to create a more psychologically safe environment.
