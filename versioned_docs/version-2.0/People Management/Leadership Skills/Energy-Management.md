# Energy Management

For two decades, I’ve seen engineering teams hit incredible milestones, and also… fizzle. I remember one team, incredibly skilled and dedicated, that stalled on a critical project. They weren't lacking the *ability* to deliver, but they were running on fumes – consistently working late, battling unclear priorities, and feeling increasingly disconnected from the larger purpose. Often, it wasn’t a lack of skill or even time that held them back. It was *energy*. We obsess over time management – calendars, to-do lists, prioritization frameworks (and believe me, I’ve used them all!). But focusing *solely* on time is like trying to power a city with a single battery. You need to manage the *energy* that fuels the people building the product.

This isn’t about “positive vibes only.” It’s a practical, often overlooked, dimension of people management that directly impacts output, quality, and team morale. Here’s how to approach energy management within your engineering team.

**The Four Dimensions of Team Energy**

I’ve found it helpful to think of team energy as existing across four dimensions. Recognizing these allows you to diagnose where the drain is occurring and tailor your approach.

* **Physical Energy:** This is the most obvious. Are people getting enough sleep? Are they consistently working long hours? Are they taking breaks? In engineering, we often glorify “hustle,” but sustainable performance requires respecting physical limits.
* **Emotional Energy:** This is about the *quality* of interactions. Is there constant conflict? Are people feeling safe to express opinions? Is there a culture of blame? Negative emotions are incredibly draining.
* **Mental Energy:** This covers focus, clarity, and cognitive load. Are engineers constantly switching between tasks due to interruptions or unclear requirements? Are they overloaded with too many tasks or complex problems? For example, are engineers constantly switching between tasks because of frequent, unplanned requests?
* **Purposeful Energy:** This is the “why” behind the work. Do engineers understand how their contributions impact the bigger picture? Do they feel a sense of ownership and meaning in their work? 



**Diagnosing Energy Leaks: Beyond the Retrospective**

Traditional retrospectives are great for identifying *what* went wrong. But they often miss the underlying *energy* drains. Here are a few ways to dig deeper:

* **The "Energy Check-In":** Start a team meeting (even a quick daily stand-up) with a simple check-in: “On a scale of 1-5, how’s your energy level today?” Don’t delve into details unless someone offers, but it establishes awareness. Be mindful that this approach might not resonate with every team; framing it as a quick team health check can make it more approachable.
* **1:1 "Energy Audit":** In your 1:1s, specifically ask about energy levels. "What's been *draining* your energy lately? What's been *energizing* you?" This is different from asking about workload.
* **Observe Team Dynamics:** Pay attention to interactions during meetings. Are people engaged and contributing, or are they withdrawn and disengaged? Look for subtle cues like body language and tone of voice. Are meetings full of complaining or constructive problem solving?
* **Anonymous Pulse Surveys:** Occasionally, use a short, anonymous survey to gauge team morale and energy levels. Focus on questions like: "I feel energized by the work I do," or "I feel safe expressing my opinions."

**Strategies for Boosting Team Energy – A Manager’s Toolkit**

Once you’ve identified the leaks, here's what you can do:

* **Protect Physical Energy:**
    * **Model Healthy Boundaries:** *You* need to take breaks and disconnect. Leading by example is *most* effective.
    * **Encourage Breaks:** Make it okay – even *expected* – for people to step away from their computers throughout the day.
    * **Meeting Hygiene:** Shorter, focused meetings with clear agendas. Seriously. Achieve this through timeboxing, strict agendas, and pre-reads.
* **Cultivate Emotional Energy:**
    * **Psychological Safety:** This is non-negotiable. Create a culture where people can take risks, admit mistakes, and challenge ideas without fear of retribution.
    * **Active Listening & Empathy:** Truly listen to your team’s concerns and acknowledge their feelings.
    * **Conflict Resolution:** Address conflicts quickly and constructively. Don’t let them fester.
* **Optimize Mental Energy:**
    * **Reduce Context Switching:** Protect engineers' focus time. Minimize interruptions and encourage deep work. Consider techniques like "maker time" or "focus blocks."
    * **Clear Requirements:** Ambiguity is energy-sapping. Ensure requirements are well-defined, documented, and understood.
    * **Manage Cognitive Load:** Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
* **Fuel Purposeful Energy:**
    * **Connect to the “Why”:** Regularly explain how the team’s work contributes to the overall company goals.
    * **Ownership & Autonomy:** Give engineers a sense of ownership over their work and empower them to make decisions.
    * **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge and celebrate successes, both big and small.

**A Cautionary Tale: The Enron Lesson**

The Enron scandal serves as a stark reminder of what happens when energy – in this case, *moral* energy – is completely misdirected. While the specifics are about accounting fraud, the underlying issue was a culture that prioritized short-term gains at the expense of everything else – trust, integrity, and even the long-term viability of the company. The pressure to meet unrealistic targets and a culture of suppressing dissent demonstrably drained the moral energy of Enron employees, ultimately contributing to the company’s downfall. 

**Energy Management is Not a "Soft Skill"**

It’s a core leadership responsibility. And it's important to acknowledge that managing team energy can be challenging, especially when you’re stretched thin yourself. It’s about understanding that your team isn't a collection of code-writing machines; they are *people* with fluctuating energy levels. By paying attention to those levels and taking steps to nurture them, you’ll build a more engaged, productive, and resilient team.
