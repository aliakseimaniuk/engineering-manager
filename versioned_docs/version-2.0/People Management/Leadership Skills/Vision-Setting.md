# Vision Setting

Imagine a team energized by a shared purpose, consistently delivering innovative solutions. That’s the power of a well-defined vision – and it’s within reach for every engineering leader. For many, “vision setting” feels like another corporate buzzword – a fluffy exercise disconnected from the daily grind of shipping software. But for engineering leaders, a *well-executed* vision setting process isn't about lofty pronouncements; it's about building a north star that aligns your team, fuels motivation, and ultimately, delivers better products. After 20+ years leading engineering teams, I've learned that a clear, shared vision is the bedrock of high performance. Here's how to move beyond the buzzword and create a vision setting process that actually works.

## The Problem with Traditional Vision Statements

Let’s be honest: how many vision statements can you recall *verbatim*? Probably very few. That’s because most are broad, aspirational, and utterly disconnected from the concrete work engineers do. Think phrases like “revolutionize the industry” or “become the leading provider.” While ambitious, these statements lack the specificity needed to guide daily decisions. 

The problem isn't ambition; it's *translation*. Engineers aren't motivated by abstract ideals; they're motivated by solving challenging problems and building things that matter. A vision needs to bridge the gap between lofty goals and concrete deliverables. Studies have shown that teams with a clearly defined and understood purpose are significantly more engaged and productive; a vague vision simply doesn’t cut it.

## From Vision to “What Are We Building & Why?”

I’ve found it far more effective to frame vision setting as answering two key questions:

1. **What are we building?** (The tangible outcome)
2. **Why are we building it?** (The impact and purpose)

This shifts the focus from abstract aspiration to concrete value. Instead of "revolutionizing communication," we might say, "We're building a real-time collaboration platform that allows distributed teams to work together seamlessly, reducing communication friction and increasing productivity."

To help facilitate this discussion, consider using a simple two-column table. Column 1: "What?" (Specific product/feature). Column 2: "Why?" (User benefit/Business impact). Filling this out collaboratively with your team is a powerful exercise. 

## The Core Components of an Effective Engineering Vision

Here's how to operationalize that "What & Why" framework:

* **Focus on Impact:** The “Why” is paramount. It’s not enough to build a technically impressive feature; it needs to solve a real problem for users or create a significant business benefit. Encourage the team to articulate *how* their work will make a difference.
* **Time Horizon:** Break down the vision into manageable chunks. A 3-6 month horizon is often ideal – long enough to tackle substantial projects, but short enough to remain relevant and adaptable. This allows for iterative refinement based on feedback and changing circumstances.
* **Technical Pillars:** Define 2-3 core technical principles that will guide your engineering efforts. These aren't specific technologies, but rather guiding principles. For example: "Prioritize scalability and reliability," "Embrace automation," or "Focus on developer experience." These pillars help the team make consistent technical decisions.
* **Measurable Outcomes:** How will you know you’re making progress toward the vision? Define key metrics that track progress and demonstrate impact. These metrics should be tied directly to the “Why” – for example, increased user engagement, reduced latency, or improved conversion rates.

I remember implementing these components during the development of a new mobile application. Initially, the team was focused on building features without a clear understanding of *why* they were important. By shifting the focus to user impact and defining measurable outcomes – like a reduction in customer support tickets – we saw a significant increase in motivation and a more focused development effort. It wasn't easy – it required challenging some assumptions and prioritizing features based on value, not just complexity – but the results were well worth it.

## Making Vision Setting a Habit, Not a Meeting

The biggest mistake is treating vision setting as a one-time event. It needs to be an ongoing conversation woven into the fabric of your team's workflow. 

* **Regular Check-Ins:** Dedicate 15-30 minutes during sprint planning or weekly team meetings to revisit the vision. Discuss progress, challenges, and how current work aligns with the overall goals.
* **Connect Daily Work to the Vision:** Encourage engineers to articulate how their tasks contribute to the bigger picture. This helps them feel more connected to the work and increases motivation.
* **Celebrate Wins:** When the team achieves a milestone that aligns with the vision, celebrate it! Recognizing progress reinforces the importance of the vision and builds momentum.

## Vision is About Alignment, Not Prediction

Consistently reinforcing the vision isn’t just about avoiding future misalignment; it’s a recognition that the future is rarely predictable. After leading teams through countless strategic shifts, I’ve realized that the *most* important thing isn’t perfectly predicting the future. It’s creating a shared understanding of *where we aim to go*, and empowering the team to adapt and innovate along the way.  

A well-defined vision isn’t a rigid roadmap; it’s a compass. It provides direction and helps the team navigate uncertainty. And for an engineering leader, that's the ultimate goal.

This week, schedule a 30-minute meeting with your team to revisit your current vision and answer the “What & Why” questions. You’ll be surprised at the impact it can have. What are your biggest challenges when it comes to setting and communicating vision to your team?
