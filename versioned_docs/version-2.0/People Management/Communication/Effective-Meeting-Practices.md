# Effective Meeting Practices

For two decades, I’ve sat in, led, and *participated in* countless meetings. Early in my career, they felt… familiar. We called them “scrums” later, trying to inject some agile flair, but fundamentally, a lot of what happened felt like it *always* had. Talking *at* each other, revisiting the same issues, and a general sense of time slipping away. It took years to realize the problem wasn’t the *meetings* themselves, but *how* we ran them. 

As engineering leaders, we’re often judged by what our teams *build*, but increasingly, we’re judged by *how* they build it – and a huge part of that ‘how’ is effective communication. Meetings are a core component of that, and getting them right isn't just about efficiency; it's about fostering a healthy, productive team culture. Let's reset our approach to meetings, focusing on practical changes that deliver real impact.

## The Meeting Landscape: Acknowledging the Problem

Before diving into solutions, let’s be honest about the current state.  Too often, meetings fall into these traps:

* **Lack of Clear Purpose:**  Why are we *actually* meeting? A vague agenda guarantees a meandering discussion.
* **The Right People Aren’t There (or Too Many Are):**  Invite only those who *need* to contribute, and ensure key stakeholders are present. I've repeatedly seen client engagements suffer when clients attended initial sales pitches but did not attend critical follow-up meetings like grooming sessions or demos. Engagement isn’t a one-time event; it requires consistent participation.
* **No Actionable Outcomes:** Discussions without clear next steps are… well, just discussions.
* **Domination by a Few Voices:**  Introverted team members – and often, the most thoughtful – can get drowned out.
* **Treating Meetings as Status Updates:**  Asynchronous communication (Slack, email, project management tools like Taiga.io or Teamwork.com) should handle information sharing. Meetings should be reserved for *solving problems* and making *decisions*.

And let's be real: we're drowning in tools.  Showtime, Tadum, Tara AI... they all promise to solve the meeting problem, but they’re just that – tools.  The real fix is about changing *behavior* and applying mindful practices.

##  A Framework for Effective Meetings: The 3 Ps

I've found a simple framework helps. I call it the 3 Ps: **Purpose, Participants, Process.**

**1. Purpose: Define & Communicate**

* **Before *any* meeting, answer this question:** What problem are we solving or what decision are we making? If you can't answer that concisely, *cancel the meeting*.
* **Send a clear agenda 24 hours in advance.** This isn’t just polite; it gives people time to prepare and think critically.  Include:
    * **The objective:** (e.g., “Decide on the approach for implementing Feature X”)
    * **Key discussion points:** (3-5 max)
    * **Pre-reading or preparation:** (if any)
* **Timeboxing:**  Assign a realistic duration.  Respect people’s time. A 30-minute meeting is often more effective than a rambling hour-long one.

**2. Participants: Be Ruthless**

* **The “Two Pizza Rule”:** Jeff Bezos famously advocated for teams small enough to be fed with two pizzas.

Keep the group as lean as possible.
* **Consider who *needs* to be there vs. who *wants* to be there.**  It’s okay to politely exclude people. “I want to keep this focused, but I’ll share a summary of the key takeaways with you afterward.”
* **Designate a facilitator.** This person is responsible for keeping the discussion on track, ensuring everyone has a chance to speak, and capturing action items. Rotate this role to develop leadership skills within the team and distribute the workload.

**3. Process: Structure for Success**

* **Start with a Recap:** Quickly review the purpose and agenda.
* **Round Robin Check-ins:**  Especially for smaller groups, a quick check-in allows everyone to share their current state of mind. It builds psychological safety and ensures everyone feels heard.
* **Structured Discussion:** Encourage active participation.  Techniques include:
    * **Brainwriting:**  Everyone writes down ideas silently for a few minutes, then shares.
    * **Dot Voting:**  Prioritize ideas by having everyone vote with a dot sticker.
    * **The “Five Whys”:**  Drill down to the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking "Why?"
* **Action Items & Ownership:**  Clearly define *who* is responsible for *what* and *by when*.  Document this in a shared space.  Tools like Tara AI can help with sprint management, but even a simple shared document will do.
* **End with a Recap:**  Summarize key decisions and action items.

## Beyond the Meeting: The Power of Retrospectives

While effective meetings address immediate issues, proactive improvement requires looking beyond the meeting itself. That's where retrospectives come in. 

Regular retrospectives (at the sprint level is a good starting point) allow the team to reflect on what went well, what didn’t, and what actions they can take to improve. 

I’ve found it's beneficial to consider both *team-level* and *organization-level* retrospectives. Team retrospectives focus on immediate improvements to workflows. Organizational retrospectives identify systemic issues that require broader changes. Validating these approaches through empirical study is crucial for ensuring they deliver lasting results.

##  Final Thoughts

Meetings aren’t the enemy. Poorly run meetings are. By adopting a mindful approach – focusing on purpose, participants, and process – you can reclaim valuable time, improve team productivity, and foster a more engaged and effective engineering organization. It's not about adding process, but about being intentional about how we meet. Start small, experiment, and iterate. 

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Define a Clear Purpose:** Before scheduling any meeting, articulate the specific problem you’re solving or the decision you’re making.
*   **Be Ruthless with Participants:** Invite only those who *need* to contribute, keeping groups as small as possible.
*   **Structure Your Process:** Utilize techniques like round robin check-ins, brainwriting, and clear action item assignments.

Your team – and your sanity – will thank you.
