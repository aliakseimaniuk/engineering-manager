# Team Meetings

For two decades, I've observed engineering teams navigate the ever-present challenge of… meetings. I recently spoke with a VP of Engineering who described his team’s weekly meeting cadence as “death by a thousand cuts.” While the tools have changed – from literal smoke signals to a bewildering array of “team collaboration” platforms – the core problems often remain stubbornly consistent. We fill our calendars, invite people, talk *at* each other, and then wonder why we haven't moved the needle. 

The irony? Meetings *should* be a powerful force multiplier. They should unlock collaboration, drive alignment, and accelerate progress. But too often, they become time sinks, breeding frustration and eroding productivity. This isn’t about eliminating meetings entirely; it's about becoming ruthlessly intentional about *why* we're meeting and *how* we're running them.

**The Agile Mirage & The Core of Effective Collaboration**

The shift towards Agile methodologies has, ironically, sometimes *increased* the meeting burden. We’ve adopted the terms – “daily scrums,” “sprint planning,” “retrospectives” – but without always understanding the underlying principles. I’ve seen teams robotically go through the motions, ticking boxes and reciting updates, without any genuine connection or problem-solving. This often happens when organizations attempt to “do Agile” as a process change without addressing the necessary cultural shift. A lack of trust and psychological safety can quickly turn these intended collaborative events into performative status reports. 

I remember one team I led where the daily “scrum” devolved into a status report read-out. People were hesitant to admit blockers, fearing judgment, and the meeting felt like a mandatory performance review. It was demoralizing and ineffective.

What I’ve learned is that the *tools* and *rituals* are less important than the underlying human needs they’re meant to address. When a team is truly functioning well, the formal structure often becomes less critical. Trust, open communication, and a shared understanding of priorities are the foundations of real collaboration.  



**Three Pillars of Intentional Meetings**

Here's a framework I use to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of meetings with my teams:

**1. Define the "Why" – Purpose & Outcome**

Before scheduling *any* meeting, ask yourself: 

* **What is the specific purpose of this meeting?** (Is it to brainstorm, make a decision, share information, solve a problem?)
* **What concrete outcome do I expect?** (A clear decision, a prioritized list of action items, a shared understanding of a complex issue?)
* **Can this outcome be achieved through another method?** (Email, a document with comments, a quick pair programming session?)

If you can't clearly articulate the purpose and outcome, *don't schedule the meeting*. It's that simple. 

| **Meeting Title:** | **Date/Time:** |
|---|---|
| **Purpose:** | **Desired Outcome:** |
| **Attendees (and why):** | **Pre-reading/Preparation:** |



**2. The Right People, The Right Format**

* **Ruthlessly prune the attendee list.**  Invite only those who are genuinely needed to contribute to the outcome.  “Just being kept in the loop” isn't a valid reason.  Consider sharing notes or recordings instead.
* **Choose the right format.**  Not every meeting needs to be a video call. Sometimes a quick voice call or a collaborative document is more efficient.
* **Timebox everything.**  Respect people's time. Start and end on time.  A tight agenda and a facilitator to keep the discussion on track are essential.
* **Consider Asynchronous Updates:** A quick video update via Loom or a well-written document can often replace a real-time meeting.




**3. Facilitation & Follow-Up**

* **Assign a facilitator.**  Their role is to ensure the meeting stays on track, encourage participation from everyone, and capture action items.
* **Establish ground rules.** Encourage active listening, respectful debate, and a focus on solutions.
* **Capture action items with clear ownership.**  Who is responsible for what, and by when?
* **Follow up with a summary.**  Share the action items and any key decisions with all attendees (and anyone who couldn't attend).

**The Cost of Bad Meetings**

Let’s be real. A poorly run meeting with five engineers is a significant drain on resources. If each engineer earns $100k/year, that’s a substantial cost – approximately $500k/hour collectively. Even a 30-minute unproductive meeting costs $2500. To illustrate, imagine your team spends just 30 minutes a week in unproductive meetings. That’s over $78,000 lost per year! It’s not just about the money; it’s about the lost opportunity cost – the coding, designing, problem-solving, and innovation that could have happened instead.

**Final Thoughts**

Meetings are inevitable. But they don’t have to be unproductive. By being intentional about purpose, attendees, and facilitation, you can transform them into powerful tools for collaboration, alignment, and progress.  

Take a look at your team’s calendar this week. Identify one recurring meeting that could be shortened, cancelled, or restructured. Experiment with these principles. This week, challenge your team to cancel one meeting that doesn't deliver clear value. You might be surprised by the impact you can have.
