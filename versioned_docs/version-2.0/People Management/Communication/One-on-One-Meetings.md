# One-On-One Meetings

For two decades, I’ve seen engineering managers fall into a predictable trap with one-on-one meetings. They often turn into status updates, missing the crucial point of these interactions. Effective one-on-ones aren’t about *what* your team is doing, but *how* they are doing it, *why* they are doing it, and – most importantly – their professional growth. 

This article dives deep into how to elevate your one-on-ones from chore to cornerstone of a thriving engineering team. 

## The Cost of the Status Update Trap

Imagine this: you're an engineering manager, and another one-on-one has just wrapped up. You’ve confirmed tasks are on track, blockers are identified, but you walk away feeling… unsatisfied. You haven't *connected* with your team member, truly understood their motivations, or uncovered potential roadblocks before they become major issues. 

This scenario is all too common. You’re likely already receiving status updates through daily stand-ups, project management tools (like Taiga.io for agile workflows), and potentially even tools tracking time and issues. Why duplicate that effort in a one-on-one? 

The answer is simple: because those other mechanisms aren't designed for *connection*. They aren't spaces for nuanced conversations about career aspirations, anxieties, skill development, or the hidden challenges impacting performance. When one-on-ones become just another report-out session, you lose the opportunity to:

* **Build Trust:** Genuine connection fosters psychological safety, encouraging team members to bring their whole selves to work. Research consistently shows a strong link between psychological safety and team performance.
* **Unlock Potential:**  Understanding individual goals and motivations allows you to tailor opportunities for growth and stretch assignments.
* **Proactively Address Issues:**  Minor frustrations, before they escalate into major roadblocks, are often revealed in a safe, confidential setting.  For example, a hidden dependency issue, voiced in a one-on-one, could prevent a critical project delay.
* **Improve Retention:** Feeling seen, heard, and supported is a powerful driver of employee loyalty.



## Shifting the Focus: A Framework for Meaningful Conversations

So, how do you break free from the status update trap? Here's a framework I've found effective, built around four key pillars:

**1. The Check-In (5-10 minutes):**  Yes, briefly touch on current work. But instead of *asking* for status, ask clarifying questions.  “What's the biggest win you’ve had since we last spoke?" or “What’s been most challenging this week?" This subtly shifts the focus from simply reporting to reflecting.

**2. Career Growth & Development (10-15 minutes):** This is the *heart* of the meeting.  Focus on long-term aspirations.  Ask questions like:
*  “What skills are you hoping to develop in the next 6-12 months?”
*  “What kind of projects are you most excited about?”
*  “What resources or support do you need to achieve your goals?”
*  “Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years, and what steps can we take to get you there?”

**3. Challenges & Roadblocks (10-15 minutes):** This isn’t about *solving* problems *for* your team members. It's about providing a safe space for them to articulate their struggles and brainstorm potential solutions *with your guidance*. Ask: “What’s slowing you down? What support do you need to overcome this challenge? What have you already tried?”

**4. Feedback & Action Items (5-10 minutes):** Two-way feedback is crucial.  Share your observations about their performance (both positive and constructive) and solicit their feedback on *your* leadership.  End with clear action items for both of you.



## Practical Tips for Maximizing Impact

To help you consistently deliver on this framework, here are some practical tips, grouped for easy implementation:

**Preparation:**

* **Consistency is Key:** Schedule recurring one-on-ones and *protect* that time. Don’t cancel unless absolutely necessary. Even 15 minutes dedicated to real connection can yield significant returns, despite a busy schedule.
* **Let Your Team Lead:** Encourage your team members to set the agenda. This demonstrates respect and ensures the meeting addresses their priorities. Tools like Tadum can help streamline agenda creation and ensure consistent focus on key topics.

**During the Meeting:**

* **Active Listening:** Put away your laptop, make eye contact, and truly listen to what your team member is saying. Paraphrase to ensure understanding.

**Follow-Up:**

* **Document Key Takeaways:** Quick notes after the meeting will help you remember important points and track progress.
* **Don't Overlook Remote Teams:** Tools like Showtime or even standard video conferencing are great for remote one-on-ones. The principles remain the same – prioritize connection and meaningful conversation. Don't let the distance diminish the quality of the interaction.



## Beyond the Meeting: Cultivating a Culture of Growth

One-on-ones are powerful, but they're most effective when part of a broader culture of continuous feedback and development. Encourage regular check-ins between team members, provide opportunities for skill-sharing and mentorship, and celebrate both individual and team accomplishments. This isn't a standalone activity, but an integral part of building a high-performing team.



**Final Thoughts:**

Mastering the art of the one-on-one isn’t about perfecting a script or ticking off a checklist. It’s about building genuine relationships with your team members, understanding their aspirations, and empowering them to reach their full potential. This week, challenge yourself to dedicate the first 10 minutes of each one-on-one to asking about your team member’s career aspirations. It’s an investment of your time that yields significant returns – a more engaged, motivated, and high-performing engineering team. And, ultimately, that's what effective leadership is all about.
