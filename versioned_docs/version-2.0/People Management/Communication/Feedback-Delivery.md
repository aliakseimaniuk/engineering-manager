# Feedback Delivery

For two decades, I've witnessed firsthand how profoundly – and how easily – feedback can impact an engineering team. Not just performance, but morale, innovation, and even retention. It’s not *if* you deliver feedback, it's *how* you deliver it. And frankly, most engineering leaders I've met are surprisingly ill-equipped to do it *well*.

We often default to the sandwich method (positive-negative-positive), or vague pronouncements of "good job" or "needs improvement." These approaches are rarely effective, and can often leave the recipient feeling confused, demotivated, or even resentful. This article isn’t about *collecting* feedback (though tools like Vidhook, feedback.fish, and Survicate can help with that). It's about the crucial *delivery* of feedback, turning it from a potentially awkward task into a powerful engine for growth.

## The Problem with "Default" Feedback

Why do we fall into these patterns? Several reasons contribute. Often, it stems from discomfort – most of us aren’t natural conflict-avoiders, but few *enjoy* delivering difficult news.  It can also be a result of a lack of training. Engineering school teaches you *how* to build things, not *how* to lead people. Finally, time constraints often lead to shortcuts. A quick "good job" feels easier than crafting thoughtful, specific feedback.

However, these shortcuts come at a cost. Vague feedback doesn't give engineers clear direction for improvement. And a constant stream of positivity without constructive criticism can create a false sense of security, hindering growth. Consider this scenario: a developer consistently misses deadlines, but receives only generic praise for their effort. While well-intentioned, this approach fails to address the underlying issue and ultimately hinders their development.

## A Framework for Effective Feedback Delivery: SBI

Over the years, I've found the **SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact)** framework to be incredibly effective. It provides structure, ensures clarity, and focuses on observable behaviors, rather than subjective interpretations.

* **Situation:** Briefly describe the context. *“During yesterday’s sprint review…”* or *“When you were pairing with Sarah on the authentication service…”*
* **Behavior:** Specifically describe the *observable* behavior. *“...you interrupted Sarah three times…”* or *“…you spent a significant amount of time debugging the front-end despite not being directly responsible for it.”* **Crucially, avoid judgment.** Don’t say “You were being aggressive” – simply describe *what you saw*.
* **Impact:** Explain the impact of that behavior. *“…which made it difficult for her to fully explain her work to the team.”* or *“…which delayed the completion of the bug fix and potentially blocked another engineer.”*

**Example:**

Let's say a team member, Alex, consistently dominates discussions in code reviews.

* **Poor Feedback:** “Alex, you need to let others speak more during code review. You're being too assertive.”
* **SBI Feedback:** “During this morning’s code review (Situation), you interrupted several team members and redirected the conversation back to your own suggestions (Behavior), which made it difficult for others to share their perspectives and slowed down the review process (Impact)."

## Beyond SBI: Principles for Maximizing Feedback Effectiveness

SBI is a powerful tool, but it’s not a magic bullet. These principles will help you maximize its effectiveness:

* **Timeliness:** Deliver feedback as close to the event as possible. Memory fades, and the impact diminishes.
* **Specificity:** The more specific you are, the more actionable the feedback becomes. Generalities are rarely helpful.
* **Focus on Behavior, Not Personality:** This is critical. You're commenting on *what* someone did, not *who* they are.
* **Listen Actively:** Feedback is a two-way street. Allow the recipient to respond, ask questions, and share their perspective.
* **Be Empathetic:** Consider the recipient’s point of view. What might be motivating their behavior? What challenges are they facing?
* **Frame it as Growth:** Present feedback as an opportunity for development, not as a criticism.

It’s also important to remember the unique dynamics within engineering teams. Engineers often value autonomy and technical expertise, so delivering constructive criticism requires sensitivity and respect. Acknowledge their skill while addressing areas for improvement.

## Addressing Difficult Conversations

Sometimes, the feedback you need to deliver is particularly challenging. Here are a few tips:

* **Prepare:** Plan what you want to say, and rehearse it if necessary.
* **Choose the Right Setting:** A private, one-on-one conversation is almost always best. Avoid delivering critical feedback in public.
* **Start with Positive Intent:** Let the person know that you're delivering feedback because you care about their growth and the team's success.
* **Focus on the Future:** While acknowledging the past, emphasize what the person can do differently moving forward.
* **Self-Awareness:** Recognize your own biases and emotional triggers. Being mindful of your own reactions will help you deliver feedback more effectively.

## Leveraging Tools for Continuous Feedback

While one-on-one conversations are essential, consider tools to facilitate *ongoing* feedback:

* **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule frequent, informal check-ins with your team members to discuss progress, challenges, and areas for improvement.
* **360-Degree Feedback:** Platforms like Lattice allow you to collect anonymous feedback from peers, direct reports, and managers, providing a comprehensive view of performance.
* **Internal Feedback Channels:** Tools like Remarkbox or even dedicated Slack channels can encourage open communication and feedback sharing.

Ultimately, delivering effective feedback isn't about being “nice.” It’s about being honest, specific, and supportive. It’s about creating a culture where engineers feel safe to learn, grow, and push themselves to be their best. Investing in effective feedback delivery creates a culture of continuous improvement, leading to a more engaged, innovative, and high-performing team.

This week, commit to using the SBI framework in your next feedback conversation. Identify one area where you can improve your feedback delivery skills and create a plan for development.
