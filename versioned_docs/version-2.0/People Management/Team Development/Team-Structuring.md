# Team Structuring

For engineering leaders, “team structure” often conjures images of org charts – boxes and lines defining reporting relationships. But a truly effective team structure goes *far* beyond that. It’s about designing a system that fosters trust, enables flow, and allows your team to consistently deliver its best work. After 20+ years in this field, I’ve learned that the ‘right’ structure isn't a one-size-fits-all solution; it’s a constantly evolving organism that needs careful nurturing.

## The Problem with Premature Structure

It's tempting to define everything upfront – roles, responsibilities, even decision-making processes. Especially when scaling. But I’ve seen too many teams paralyzed by rigid structures imposed *before* they’ve had a chance to organically find their rhythm.

I once joined a startup where the CEO, a seasoned executive, immediately implemented a detailed RACI matrix for every conceivable task. The intention was good – clarity and accountability. The result? A team stifled by process, spending more time documenting *who* did *what* than actually *doing* the work. The initial energy quickly drained, and we lost valuable momentum – innovation stalled, morale plummeted, and our time to market for critical features significantly extended.

The lesson? **Start with people, not process.** Understand their strengths, how they collaborate, and where they naturally gravitate. Let the structure *emerge* from that understanding.

## Beyond Roles: Defining *How* We Work Together

Forget just defining *what* people do; focus on *how* they interact. Here are a few critical elements to consider:

* **Clear Ownership (Without Silos):** Ownership is vital, but it shouldn’t create isolated silos. Think about “DRI” (Directly Responsible Individual) instead of solely focusing on ‘owner’. The DRI is accountable, but should actively solicit input and collaborate. This nuance prevents “my code, my problem” scenarios.
* **Decision-Making Authority:** Explicitly define *who* makes which decisions. A simple framework I've found helpful is:
  * **Receive:** Information shared with the team.
  * **Consult:** Input sought from specific individuals.
  * **Agree:** Decisions made collaboratively.
  * **Advise:** Recommendations given to decision-makers.
  * **Direct:** Individual makes the final call.
* **Communication Channels:** How will the team share information? Slack channels, daily stand-ups, weekly summaries? The *method* matters less than consistency and ensuring the right information reaches the right people.
* **Conflict Resolution:** Let’s be real – conflict is inevitable. Establish a safe and constructive process for addressing disagreements. This could be as simple as encouraging direct, respectful conversation or involving a neutral third party.

## The Power of Small, Trusting Teams

While scaling is important, resist the urge to create massive teams. I've consistently found that smaller teams (5-9 members) are the most effective. Why?

* **Increased Trust:** It’s easier to build trust and rapport in a smaller group.
* **Better Communication:** Fewer people mean fewer communication bottlenecks.
* **Faster Decision-Making:** Smaller teams can iterate and make decisions more quickly.
* **Greater Accountability:** Everyone is more visible and accountable in a smaller group.

The article references the observation that "when within a smaller and well-functioning team, the totems of Agile often fly out of the window.” This is *exactly* what happens. When trust is high and communication is open, the need for rigid processes diminishes. Teams naturally prioritize collaboration and delivering value over strict adherence to prescribed methodologies.

## Iterating on Your Structure: Retrospectives are Key

Team structure isn’t static. It needs to evolve as your team grows, your project changes, and your priorities shift. That's where regular retrospectives come in.

Research by Derby, Larsen, and Schwaber (2006) highlights the benefits of both team-level and organization-level retrospectives, reinforcing the importance of addressing issues at all levels. I agree wholeheartedly. Team retrospectives are great for identifying immediate roadblocks, but organization-level retrospectives help you identify systemic issues and adjust structures *across* teams.

**Here's a simple retrospective framework:**

1. **What went well?** (Celebrate successes)
2. **What didn't go well?** (Identify challenges)
3. **What can we improve?** (Develop action items)

For example, in a recent retrospective, my team identified that our daily stand-ups had become too lengthy and unfocused. The action item was to implement a strict five-minute time limit and encourage asynchronous updates for non-critical information. This seemingly small change significantly improved our team's velocity and focus.

Be disciplined about implementing those action items and revisiting them in subsequent retrospectives. Changing established structures can be challenging, and it’s important to acknowledge that resistance to change is natural. Be transparent about the reasons for the changes and actively solicit feedback from your team.

## Final Thoughts

Building an effective team structure is less about *designing* a perfect system and more about *facilitating* a collaborative environment where people can thrive. Focus on building trust, fostering open communication, and empowering your team to take ownership. Embrace iteration, learn from your mistakes, and remember that the best team structure is the one that allows your team to consistently deliver its best work.
