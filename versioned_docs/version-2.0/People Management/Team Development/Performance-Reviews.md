# Performance Reviews

For two decades, I’ve seen performance reviews swing wildly between the pointless and the painful. They're often treated as a necessary evil – a bureaucratic hoop to jump through, a time sink for managers, and a source of anxiety for team members. But what if we could *reclaim* performance reviews? What if they could actually be valuable drivers of growth, motivation, and high performance?

The problem isn't the *idea* of performance review; it’s how we’ve traditionally *executed* them. Too often, we get bogged down in forced rankings, standardized forms, and subjective ratings that feel detached from real work. We treat it like a scorekeeping exercise instead of a conversation about growth. I’ve even seen managers, myself included early in my career, treat the writing of these reviews as a last-minute scramble, fulfilling administrative requirements rather than genuinely reflecting on someone’s contributions. 

Let's move beyond the boxes and focus on building a truly impactful process. Here’s how.

## The Problem with Traditional Reviews

Before we dive into solutions, let’s pinpoint what’s *not* working. 

* **Recency Bias:** We tend to overemphasize recent events, forgetting contributions made earlier in the review period.
* **Halo/Horns Effect:** A single positive or negative trait can disproportionately influence our overall assessment.
* **Subjectivity & Vagueness:** Terms like “good communicator” or “needs improvement” are open to interpretation and lack concrete examples.
* **Lack of Ongoing Feedback:** Waiting for an annual review to address issues feels…delayed. It’s often too late to course-correct effectively.
* **Focus on Weaknesses:** While constructive criticism is important, an overemphasis on what’s *wrong* can be demotivating and stifle innovation.

I remember early in my career, dutifully filling out review forms with little more than a summary of completed tasks. It felt…empty. There was no real conversation, no discussion of aspirations, no tailored guidance. The engineer likely felt as uninspired by the review as I felt writing it. 

## Shifting the Focus: From Evaluation to Growth

The most effective performance reviews aren’t about *evaluating* performance; they’re about *facilitating growth*.  Here's a framework to guide that shift:

**1. Frequent, Informal Check-Ins (The "Always Be Reviewing" Approach):** This is the foundation. Regular one-on-ones, even 15-30 minutes a week, are crucial. These aren't formal reviews, but opportunities to discuss progress, challenges, and goals in real-time. Think of it as "in-flight adjustments" rather than a post-flight report. It's about consistent support and guidance, *not* constant scrutiny.

**2. The STAR Method – With an Impact Focus:** The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is great for providing specific examples. However, focus on *impact*. Instead of just describing *what* someone did, emphasize *how* their actions benefited the team, the product, or the company.  For example, instead of saying "Sarah implemented a new caching layer," you could say, "Sarah implemented a new caching layer, which reduced page load times by 20% and improved user engagement."

**3. Focus on Strengths & Development Areas:** Instead of a “strengths and weaknesses” section, try “strengths to leverage” and “development areas to explore.” Frame development areas as opportunities for growth, not deficiencies to fix. Ask the engineer how *they* see their development and what support they need.

**4. Goal Alignment & Future Aspirations:** Connect individual goals to team and company objectives. Discuss career aspirations and how you can help the engineer achieve them. This shows you’re invested in their long-term success.

**5. Two-Way Dialogue – It’s Not a Monologue:** Make the review a conversation, not a lecture. Ask open-ended questions and actively listen to the engineer’s perspective. Solicit feedback on *your* performance as a manager.



**A Shift in Perspective:**

| **Traditional Review** | **Growth Conversation** |
|---|---|
| Focus on past performance | Focus on future potential |
| Top-down evaluation | Collaborative dialogue |
| Identifying weaknesses | Leveraging strengths & exploring development areas |
| Annual event | Ongoing conversation |


## The Importance of Data – Informed, Not Driven

Data can be a valuable supplement to performance reviews, but it shouldn't be the sole driver. When utilizing metrics, remember they offer a *perspective* – not a definitive judgment. Relying solely on quantitative data can incentivize gaming the system or overlook crucial qualitative contributions. 

Consider these examples:

* **Code Review Metrics:** Contributions, complexity of changes, etc.
* **Bug/Incident Rates:** Identifying areas for improvement in code quality or testing.
* **Project Completion Rates:** Demonstrating consistent delivery.
* **Peer Feedback:** Collect anonymous feedback from colleagues.

Always contextualize data with observations from one-on-ones and a thorough understanding of the engineer’s role and challenges. 

## Final Thoughts

Performance reviews don’t have to be dreaded. They can be powerful tools for growth, motivation, and building high-performing teams. It requires a shift in mindset – from evaluation to growth – and a commitment to ongoing feedback and dialogue. 

Stop treating performance reviews as an administrative task and start treating them as an opportunity to invest in your people. You’ll be amazed at the results. 

**To get started, this week, try incorporating one open-ended question into your next one-on-one to solicit feedback from your engineer. For example, “What’s one thing I can do to better support your work this week?”**
