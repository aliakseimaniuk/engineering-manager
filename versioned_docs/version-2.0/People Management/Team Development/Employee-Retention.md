# Employee Retention

Employee retention. It’s the holy grail of people management, a constant worry for engineering leaders, and a topic drowning in generic advice. "Offer competitive salaries," "Foster a positive work environment," "Provide growth opportunities." Sure, those are *factors*, but they rarely address the core reason good engineers walk out the door: a slow, creeping sense of futility. 

Having been employee #39 at a rapidly scaling company, I’ve seen firsthand that it's not boredom that drives people to quit – it’s the repeated silencing of good ideas. It's the feeling that your voice doesn’t matter, that your efforts are a drop in the bucket, and that leadership isn’t listening. This isn’t about lacking ping pong tables or free lunches; it’s a fundamental disconnect between individual contribution and organizational impact.

**The “Two or Three Times” Rule**

I call it the "Two or Three Times" rule. When a team member, especially a strong one, brings a well-thought-out proposal for improvement – *especially* a proposal that aligns with company goals – and it’s met with resistance, dismissal, or inaction… twice, three times… something cracks. They’re not just frustrated about *that* proposal. They’re realizing that the system isn’t designed to *hear* their ideas.  

They begin to understand that their continued employment is pointless. They stop investing discretionary effort. They start looking elsewhere. And it's not about being *bored* – it's about being *disempowered*.

In my experience, this manifests subtly. I once witnessed a talented engineer repeatedly champion innovative solutions for a critical performance bottleneck. Each suggestion was initially acknowledged but ultimately stalled due to “priorities” and a lack of dedicated resources. By the third instance, she had visibly disengaged, her contributions dwindling, and she eventually accepted a position elsewhere. This wasn’t a case of burnout; it was a case of being unheard.

This is especially acute in engineering. Engineers are, by nature, problem-solvers. They *want* to improve things.  Suppressing that instinct is a slow form of organizational self-sabotage.

**Why Traditional Retention Efforts Fail**

So why do so many retention strategies miss the mark? Because they focus on *treating symptoms* instead of addressing the *root cause*. Competitive salaries are important, but they won't keep someone who feels unheard. “Positive work environment” initiatives feel hollow if the underlying system doesn’t value individual contributions.

I’ve seen metrics that back this up – a significant number of requests and attempts at improvement being made (100K/month in one case). This data came from analyzing internal ticketing and communication systems within a previous organization. While it demonstrates engagement, the short retention (3 days average before the employee disengaged or left) suggests that engagement isn’t translating to feeling valued. This isn’t a problem of employee apathy; it’s a systemic issue.

**What Engineering Managers Can Do: A Practical Framework**

Here's a practical framework for engineering managers, focused on preventing the "Two or Three Times" scenario and building a culture of empowered contribution:

**1. The "Idea Intake" Process:**

* **Dedicated Channels:** Establish clear channels for proposal submission – beyond the standard stand-up or sprint planning. This could be a dedicated Slack channel, a monthly "innovation hour," or a lightweight Jira project specifically for initiatives.
* **Rapid Triage:** *Crucially*, establish a rapid triage process. Every proposal deserves a response – even if it's just a quick “Thank you, we’ve considered this and it’s not a priority right now, with this reasoning”. Silence is the enemy.
* **Public Visibility:** Make the status of proposals visible to the team. A simple Kanban board showing "Under Review," "Planned," "Implemented," and "Rejected" provides transparency and accountability.

**2. The "Why" Behind Rejection:**

This is where most organizations fail. Rejecting a proposal isn’t enough. You *must* explain the rationale. Is it a technical limitation? A conflicting priority? A lack of resources? Be honest and transparent. 

* **Avoid Vague Excuses:** “Not a priority right now” is a death knell. "We're currently focused on stabilizing the core platform, so any feature work is on hold until Q2" is far more palatable.
* **Solicit Alternative Solutions:** Turn rejection into a conversation. "That's an interesting idea, but we're facing X challenge. Do you have any thoughts on how we could address it in a different way?"

**3. Empowered Experimentation:**

* **"20% Time" (or Similar):** Encourage engineers to dedicate a small portion of their time to exploring their own ideas. This isn’t just about innovation; it’s about fostering a sense of ownership and autonomy.
* **Small-Scale Pilots:** When a promising idea emerges, don’t get bogged down in lengthy planning cycles. Encourage small-scale pilots to test the concept quickly and gather data.
* **Celebrate Failures (as Learning Opportunities):** Not every experiment will succeed. Celebrate the learnings from failures and encourage a culture of experimentation.

**Small Experiments, Big Impact**
This creates a safe space to try new things without fear of negative consequences.

**4. Active Listening & Follow-Through**

* **One-on-Ones Focused on Ideas:** Dedicate a portion of your one-on-ones to discussing proposals, suggestions, and potential improvements. 
* **Document & Track:** Keep a record of proposals that have been submitted and the status of each. This demonstrates that you’re taking them seriously.
* **Close the Loop:** When a proposal is implemented (even months later), let the engineer know. A simple “Remember that suggestion you made about X? We just rolled it out!” goes a long way.



**Beyond Perks: A Culture of Contribution**

Employee retention isn’t about throwing money at the problem. It's about creating a culture where engineers feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute their best work. It’s about recognizing that the most valuable asset isn’t the technology you build, but the people who build it.  

Stop focusing on boredom, and start understanding why voices are being silenced. 

Take a moment to consider: How can *you* create a culture where voices are heard and contributions are valued?
