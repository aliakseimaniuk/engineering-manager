# Succession Planning

For 20+ years, I’ve seen teams and organizations thrive, and I’ve seen them stumble. More often than not, the stumbles aren’t caused by bad technology or market shifts, but by a surprisingly preventable issue: a lack of succession planning. It's often relegated to the “executive things” list, but that's a dangerous oversight. True succession planning isn’t just about identifying who takes over *after* someone leaves; it’s a proactive strategy to build a resilient, high-performing team, and frankly, it's a core responsibility of engineering managers.

I recently worked with a team where a senior engineer, the sole expert on a critical legacy system, took an unexpected medical leave. The project ground to a halt. Weeks were lost to frantic knowledge transfer, duplicated effort, and ultimately, a delayed release. This isn't an isolated incident. I’ve seen firsthand how a single, unexpected departure – even at a mid-level position – can derail a project, fracture a team, and bring momentum screeching to a halt. The reasons are usually the same: critical knowledge lives in one person’s head, no one else has been cross-trained, and the team is scrambling to pick up the pieces *after* the fact. That’s reactive, and it’s exhausting.

Let's explore why succession planning is vital for engineering managers, how to approach it effectively, and why ignoring it is a slow burn towards systemic failure.

## Beyond the VP Slot: Why *Your* Team Needs Succession Planning

We often associate succession planning with identifying the next CEO or VP of Engineering. But what about the senior staff engineer who is the sole expert on a critical legacy system? Or the tech lead who understands the intricate architecture of a key microservice? These “single points of failure” are just as damaging, and they’re far more common than a missing executive.

The core principle is this: **for every role, identify who *could* step in and maintain functionality, even at a reduced capacity, if the current occupant were unexpectedly unavailable.** This doesn’t mean grooming a perfect replacement overnight. It means building a foundation of shared knowledge, establishing a foundation of shared knowledge, fostering skill development, and proactively identifying potential internal candidates.

Failing to account for sufficient roles and individuals to fill them doesn’t just lead to overloaded team members; it ultimately leads to failure. As the provided context highlights, this leads to overburdening and increased risk. You’re not just filling positions; you’re building redundancy into the system, ensuring the team can absorb unexpected disruptions.

## A Practical Framework for Engineering Succession Planning

Here's a four-step framework I've adapted over the years. Instead of viewing this as a linear process, it's more effective to think of it as a continuous cycle of assessment, development, and refinement.

1. **Identify Critical Roles & Knowledge:** Start by mapping out your team’s key functions. What are the essential tasks and responsibilities? Where does critical knowledge reside? Be brutally honest. Don't just think about *what* people do, but *how* they do it. What undocumented processes or tribal knowledge are vital to success?

2. **Skills Gap Analysis:** For each critical role, identify the skills needed to perform those functions effectively. Then, assess your team’s current skill set. Where are the gaps? This isn’t about blaming individuals; it's about identifying areas for growth and development. Here's an example of what that assessment might look like:

| Role | Required Skill | Current Skill Level (Team Average) | Development Actions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tech Lead - Microservice X | Kubernetes Deployment | Intermediate | Encourage attendance at advanced Kubernetes workshops |
| Senior Engineer - Legacy System Y | COBOL Debugging | Novice | Pair with current expert for knowledge transfer |
| Data Engineer | Data Pipeline Optimization | Advanced | Mentor junior engineers in best practices |

1. **Development & Cross-Training:** This is where the real work begins. Invest in your team’s development. Encourage cross-training, mentorship, and knowledge sharing. This could include:
    * **Shadowing:** Pair individuals in different roles to learn from each other.
    * **Documentation:** Create (and *maintain*) clear, concise documentation of critical processes.
    * **“Lunch & Learn” Sessions:** Have team members share their expertise with others. These sessions can be particularly valuable for succession planning when focused on transferring critical skills and knowledge. Encourage engineers to document and present on topics where they are the sole expert.
    * **Dedicated Time for Exploration:** Allow engineers to spend a percentage of their time working on projects outside of their primary responsibilities to broaden their skills.

2. **Regular Review & Update:** Succession planning isn’t a “set it and forget it” exercise. Regularly review your plan, update skill assessments, and adjust your development initiatives as needed. Team structures and priorities change, and your succession plan should reflect those changes.

## The Importance of "Post Mortems" – And How They Relate

Each time someone leaves the team (even for a new opportunity – not just unexpectedly), conduct a thorough retrospective. This is a critical step in refining your succession plan.

* What knowledge did they take with them?
* What processes were disrupted?
* What could we have done differently to mitigate the impact?

The provided context emphasizes that understanding how these reviews affect different levels of organizational control is key – ensure the corrective actions are implemented at the right level. For example, a gap in documentation might necessitate a team-wide initiative to improve documentation standards, while a skills gap might require targeted training for specific individuals. Use these insights to refine your succession plan and prevent similar disruptions in the future.

## Don’t Wait for a Crisis

Succession planning is often perceived as a reactive measure – something you do *after* someone leaves. But that’s a mistake. Proactive succession planning is an investment in your team’s resilience, your project’s stability, and your own peace of mind.

It's about building a team that can adapt to change, overcome challenges, and continue to deliver value, even in the face of unexpected disruptions. It's about building an engineering organization capable of sustained performance, not just reliant on individual heroes.

As the final line of the provided context suggests, just *try* to build something amazing. But don’t just *try* - start today. Schedule a 30-minute meeting with your team to identify critical roles and begin mapping out potential successors. Investing in succession planning is a critical step in ensuring that your team, and your work, can endure.
