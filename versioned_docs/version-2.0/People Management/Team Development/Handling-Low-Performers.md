# Handling Low Performers

Handling low performers is arguably *the* hardest part of being an engineering manager. It’s not about technical challenges, or project timelines, but about people – their careers, their livelihoods, and often, their self-worth. For many new managers, it’s the skill they actively *avoid* developing, hoping the situation will resolve itself. It rarely does. Over my 20+ years, I've learned that addressing performance issues effectively isn't about being a disciplinarian, but about being a *courageous* leader – one who prioritizes both the needs of the team and the growth of the individual.

This isn't just about "fixing" someone. It's about understanding *why* performance is lagging, and deciding – together, if possible – on the best path forward.

## The Danger of Avoidance and the Subtle Erosion of Team Performance

It's tempting to let low performance slide, especially if it’s a generally well-liked individual. We think, “They’ll figure it out,” or “It’s just a temporary slump.” But that thinking is deeply flawed. As a team, you're building a shared standard of performance. When low performance isn't addressed, it can negatively impact the team and erode overall performance. High performers notice, and resentment can build. They may start to question *your* judgment, or worse, lower their own standards to avoid being the "only one" carrying the load. 

Think of it like a system bottleneck. Just as a slow component can degrade the performance of an entire application, a low-performing team member can hinder the progress and morale of everyone else. Ignoring low performance is akin to leaving technical debt unaddressed – it accumulates over time and becomes increasingly costly to resolve.

## Diagnosing the Root Cause: Beyond “Lack of Skill”

Before jumping to conclusions, you *must* understand *why* someone is underperforming. It's almost never just about “lack of skill.” Here's a framework I’ve found helpful:

* **Skill Gap:** Do they genuinely lack the technical expertise required? (This is rarer than you think, and often masked by other issues).
* **Motivation/Engagement:** Are they disengaged, bored, or feeling undervalued? Are they working on things that don't align with their strengths or interests?
* **Context/Support:** Do they have the necessary resources, tools, and mentorship to succeed? Are there roadblocks in their way you haven't addressed?
* **Personal Issues:** Is something happening outside of work impacting their performance? (Be cautious and empathetic here – you are *not* a therapist, but acknowledging that life happens is crucial.)
* **Mismatch:** Is the role simply not a good fit for their skills and aspirations? 

Don't rely on assumptions. Have a direct, private conversation. Ask open-ended questions. Here are some examples for each cause:

*   **Skill Gap:** "What parts of this project are proving most challenging? Are there any specific areas where you'd like additional training or mentorship?"
*   **Motivation/Engagement:** "How are you feeling about the work you're currently doing? Are you finding it stimulating and engaging?"
*   **Context/Support:** "Do you have everything you need to be successful in this project? Are there any roadblocks I can help remove?"
*   **Personal Issues:** "I've noticed a change in your performance lately. I want to check in and see if everything is okay. Of course, you don't have to share anything you're not comfortable with."
*   **Mismatch:** "Looking back, do you feel the responsibilities of this role align with your strengths and interests? Are you finding the work fulfilling?"

"I've noticed [specific behavior/output]. Can you help me understand what's going on?" is far more effective than “Why aren’t you meeting expectations?”



## The Conversation: Directness with Empathy

Once you've diagnosed the issue, it's time for a challenging conversation. Here's how to approach it:

1. **Be Specific:** Avoid vague feedback like "You need to improve your coding." Instead, say, "I noticed several bugs in your recent pull request, specifically around error handling in the authentication module."
2. **Focus on Behavior, Not Personality:** “The code wasn't well-documented" is better than "You're a sloppy coder." 
3. **Explain the Impact:** “These bugs caused a critical production issue, delaying the release and requiring a rollback.” Help them understand the consequences of their performance.
4. **Collaborate on a Plan:** Don't just dictate solutions. Ask, "What support do you need to improve this?" "What steps can we take to get you back on track?”
5. **Set Clear Expectations and Timelines:** “Let’s agree to revisit this in two weeks and review your progress.”

Remember, the goal isn't to berate someone, but to help them improve. Treat them with respect and empathy, even when delivering difficult feedback. 

## The Difficult Decision: When Improvement Isn’t Possible

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, improvement isn’t possible. This is the hardest part of the process. You've given them feedback, provided support, and given them a chance to improve. If performance *still* doesn't meet expectations, you have a responsibility to the team to make a tough decision.

This might involve:

* **A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP):** A formal, documented plan with specific goals, timelines, and consequences.
* **Role Change:** Exploring whether a different role within the organization might be a better fit.
* **Termination:** As a last resort, if all other options have been exhausted.

This is where strong documentation is essential. Protect yourself and the company by meticulously recording all feedback, conversations, and actions taken. It’s also vital to involve HR in this process, ensuring consistency with company policy and adherence to legal requirements. Terminations are difficult for all involved – both the employee and the manager – and require careful handling and empathy.

## The Leader's Responsibility: Setting the Standard

Handling low performers isn’t just about dealing with *individual* issues. It’s about establishing a culture of accountability and high performance within your team. It requires courage, empathy, and a commitment to doing what’s best for everyone involved. 

It’s uncomfortable. It’s challenging. But it's a fundamental part of being an effective engineering manager.

Proactive performance management is vital. Addressing issues early, providing regular feedback, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement not only benefit individual team members but also contribute to a more engaged, productive, and successful engineering organization.
