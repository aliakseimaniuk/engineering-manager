# Hiring

Hiring. It’s the lifeblood of any growing engineering organization, and yet, it consistently ranks as a top stressor for engineering managers. How many hours have you spent sifting through resumes, only to find that the ‘perfect’ candidate on paper doesn’t translate to a high performer on the team? If you’re like most engineering managers, the answer is… too many. After 20+ years of experience in this field, leading teams at both startups and larger companies, I’ve learned that hiring isn’t just about filling a seat; it's about building a team with the right *potential*, not just the right skills listed on their resume. 

This post isn’t about quick tips for writing job descriptions. It’s about building a robust hiring *process* – one that focuses on identifying candidates who will thrive in *your* specific environment, contribute to your team’s culture, and ultimately, help you achieve your goals. This framework has proven effective in reducing time-to-hire and improving team performance, based on my experience.

## The Problem with Traditional Hiring

Traditional hiring often relies heavily on resumes and technical interviews. While these are important, they’re notoriously poor predictors of long-term success. Why?

* **Resume Optimization:** Candidates have become experts at “gaming” the resume system. Keywords and buzzwords often overshadow actual skills and experience.
* **Technical Interview Anxiety:** A high-pressure technical interview doesn't accurately reflect how a candidate performs in a real-world, collaborative environment. Someone who freezes under pressure might be a brilliant coder when given the space to think.
* **The "Culture Fit" Fallacy:** Often “culture fit” translates to hiring people who are just like *you*. This leads to homogeneity and stifles innovation. We need to focus on *culture add* – bringing in diverse perspectives that enhance the team.
* **Ignoring Behavioral Signals:** We often prioritize technical prowess over how someone *works* – their communication style, problem-solving approach, and ability to learn. 

## Building a Better Hiring Process: A Multi-Stage Approach

Here’s a framework I’ve refined over the years, moving beyond the resume-first approach:

**1. Define the “Ideal Team Player” (Not Just the Ideal Candidate)**

Before you even write a job description, sit down with your team and define *what makes someone successful on *this* team*. What are the core values? What are the critical soft skills? What behaviors do you want to encourage? This isn't about finding a perfect replica of existing team members; it's about identifying the characteristics that will *complement* the team. A simple matrix can be helpful here - list key attributes (e.g., communication, collaboration, proactiveness) and define what those look like at different levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

**2. The “Screen & Learn” Phase – Initial Assessment & Behavioral Focus**

This phase is designed to quickly assess candidates beyond their resumes and identify those who demonstrate the core attributes you're looking for.

* **Asynchronous Screening:** Instead of immediately jumping on a phone screen, consider an asynchronous assessment. This could be a short coding challenge (focused on problem-solving, not just syntax), a take-home assignment simulating a real-world task, or a short video response to a few pre-defined questions. This saves everyone time and gives you a clearer signal before investing in a live conversation.
* **Behavioral-First Phone Screen:**  If the asynchronous assessment looks promising, *lead with behavioral questions* on the initial phone screen. Don't immediately dive into technical details. Ask about past projects, challenges they've faced, and how they worked with others. "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly" is far more valuable than "Are you proficient in Python?"
* **Visual Aid Suggestion:** Create a "screening scorecard" with key attributes (communication, problem-solving, teamwork) and a rating scale. This helps maintain consistency and objectivity.

**3. The Collaborative Deep Dive**

This phase focuses on observing candidates in a more realistic work environment. 

* **The “Pairing” Interview:** Instead of a single interviewer grilling the candidate, pair them with a team member to work on a small, realistic problem. This simulates the actual working environment and allows you to observe their collaborative skills, communication style, and problem-solving approach in real-time.
* **The “Design Challenge”:** For more senior roles, a design challenge can be highly effective. Present a loosely defined problem and ask the candidate to walk you through their thought process, design choices, and potential trade-offs. For example, we once asked candidates to design a simple API for a feature, focusing on their ability to articulate trade-offs and consider edge cases. This reveals their ability to think strategically and communicate complex ideas.
* **Team Feedback is Crucial:** After each interview stage, gather feedback from everyone involved. Don’t rely on gut feelings; focus on specific behaviors and observations.

**4. Beyond Skills: Assessing “Learnability” and “Growth Potential”**

In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, skills become obsolete quickly. Prioritize candidates who demonstrate a genuine passion for learning, a growth mindset, and the ability to adapt to new challenges. Look for candidates who show a commitment to continuous improvement. Ask questions like:

* “What are you currently learning?”
* “What’s the most challenging thing you’ve learned recently?”
* “Describe a time you failed and what you learned from it.”

## Remember: Hiring is a Two-Way Street

Don’t forget that candidates are also evaluating *you*. We know you’re busy, which is why this process is designed to be efficient and effective. Make sure to provide a positive candidate experience, be transparent about the role and the company culture, and give them ample opportunities to ask questions. 

**Final Thought:** Hiring isn't about finding the "perfect" candidate. It's about finding the *right* candidate – someone who aligns with your team's values, has the potential to grow, and will contribute to a positive and productive work environment. By focusing on building a robust process and prioritizing people over skills, you can significantly increase your chances of building a high-performing engineering team.
