# Celebrating Diversity

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) have become ubiquitous terms in the tech industry, and for good reason. A diverse team isn’t just “the right thing to do” (though it absolutely is); it’s a business imperative. But too often, DEI initiatives feel like a checklist of activities – trainings, recruitment targets, employee resource groups – without fundamentally changing how we build and operate engineering teams. We get caught in *talking* about diversity, instead of *building* inclusive environments where everyone can thrive. 

As an engineering leader for over two decades, I've seen both the well-intentioned but ineffective DEI programs and those that genuinely unlock innovation and growth. This isn’t about hitting quotas; it’s about fundamentally rethinking how we approach team building, career development, and technical leadership. Let’s move beyond the buzzwords and explore how to build *truly* inclusive engineering teams.

## The Tension Within Collective Fictions

Recently, I was reading Yuval Harari’s *Sapiens*, and a particular idea struck me as surprisingly relevant to DEI. Harari argues that human societies are built upon “collective fictions” – shared beliefs that aren’t necessarily objectively true, but enable large-scale cooperation. Concepts like money, nations, and human rights fall into this category. 

What’s fascinating – and often problematic – is that these collective fictions *conflict*. The ideals of equality and helping everyone can, paradoxically, pave the way for oppressive systems when taken to extremes or implemented without nuance. Think about it: strong beliefs *can* be weaponized.

This tension, I believe, plays out powerfully in DEI. We *collectively* agree that diversity is valuable, but unexamined assumptions and ingrained biases can undermine those intentions. We might *say* we want a diverse team, but our hiring processes, promotion criteria, and even everyday communication patterns might inadvertently favor certain groups over others.  The conflict arises when our stated commitment to inclusivity clashes with deeply held, often unconscious, biases. Just as collective fictions require constant reinforcement, so too does genuine inclusivity require continuous self-reflection and dismantling of inequitable systems. It’s not enough to *believe* in DEI; we have to constantly challenge our own biases and actively dismantle systems that perpetuate inequality.

## From Policy to Practice: Three Pillars of Inclusive Engineering Teams

So how do we bridge the gap between good intentions and tangible results? I’ve found that focusing on three core pillars is crucial:

**1. Inclusive Hiring & Onboarding:**

This goes *way* beyond simply posting job descriptions on diverse platforms (though that's a good start!).  

* **Blind Resume Reviews:** Remove names, schools, and other identifying information from initial resume screening.
* **Structured Interviews:** Use standardized questions and scoring criteria for all candidates. This reduces the impact of unconscious bias. Have a diverse interview panel.
* **Skills-Based Assessments:** Evaluate candidates based on demonstrable skills, not just experience or pedigree. Coding challenges, design exercises, or problem-solving scenarios are valuable.
* **Inclusive Onboarding:** Ensure new hires feel welcomed, supported, and have the resources they need to succeed. Pair them with mentors from diverse backgrounds.

**2. Equitable Growth & Development:**

Diversity without equity is unsustainable. We need to create environments where *everyone* has the opportunity to grow and advance.

* **Transparent Career Paths:** Clearly define career ladders and promotion criteria. Make this information accessible to all team members.
* **Sponsorship Programs:** Pair high-potential employees from underrepresented groups with senior leaders who can advocate for their career advancement. (Sponsorship is different from mentorship – it's about actively opening doors and championing someone's growth).
* **Bias Interruption Training:** Equip team members with the skills to recognize and interrupt unconscious bias in everyday interactions.
* **Regular Feedback & Performance Reviews:** Provide constructive feedback and support career development. Be mindful of potential bias in performance evaluations.

**3. Psychological Safety & Inclusive Leadership:**

This is the hardest part, but arguably the most important. Psychological safety is the belief that you can speak up, share ideas, and take risks without fear of negative consequences. 

* **Lead by Example:** As a leader, model vulnerability, humility, and a willingness to learn from others.
* **Create Space for Diverse Perspectives:** Actively solicit feedback from all team members. Ensure everyone has a voice in discussions.
* **Address Microaggressions:** Microaggressions are subtle, often unintentional, expressions of bias. Address them promptly and respectfully.
* **Celebrate Differences:** Acknowledge and appreciate the unique strengths and perspectives that each team member brings to the table.

**Addressing Resistance to Change**

Building psychological safety also means acknowledging that discomfort is inevitable. I recently worked with a team where a senior engineer, initially resistant to DEI initiatives, expressed concern about “lowering the bar.” By creating a safe space for open dialogue and framing inclusivity as a benefit to *everyone* – leading to better problem-solving and innovation – we were able to address his concerns and foster a more inclusive environment. 

## Beyond the Checklist: A Continuous Journey

Building truly inclusive engineering teams isn't a one-time fix. It’s a continuous journey that requires ongoing effort, self-reflection, and a commitment to challenging the status quo. 

I recommend regularly assessing your team's DEI efforts using both quantitative data (e.g., representation metrics) and qualitative feedback (e.g., employee surveys, focus groups). Be honest about your shortcomings and celebrate your successes.  Regularly share progress—and challenges—with the team to foster transparency.

Just like the tensions inherent in Harari’s concept of “collective fictions”, the path to inclusivity isn't always straightforward. But the rewards – increased innovation, improved team performance, and a more equitable and fulfilling workplace – are well worth the effort.

**Start Small, Start Now**

To begin, assess your current DEI efforts in one key area – hiring, growth, or psychological safety – and identify one concrete step you can take this week.
