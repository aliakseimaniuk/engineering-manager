# Burnout Indicators

I recently spoke with an engineering manager who confessed his star developer had quietly resigned. Not for a bigger salary, or a fancier title. He was simply… depleted. Months of relentless pressure, unrealistic deadlines, and a constant stream of urgent requests had extinguished his passion. This isn’t an isolated incident. We obsess over velocity, story points, and cycle time, and while these metrics are *important*, they tell a story with a glaring blind spot: the human cost of delivery. As engineering leaders, we're responsible for building *sustainable* high-performance teams, and that means understanding – and actively monitoring – the indicators of burnout *before* they cripple productivity and drive valuable people away.

I’ve seen it happen too many times. Teams pushing relentlessly, hitting sprint goals, seemingly “on fire.” Then, slowly, the energy drains. Commit frequency drops. Code quality suffers. Suddenly, the high-performers are quiet, withdrawn, and eventually… gone. They weren’t just bored; they were exhausted. And often, the warning signs were there all along – we just weren't looking for them.

This isn't about fluffy "wellness initiatives." It's about *risk management*. Burnout isn't a personality flaw; it's a predictable outcome of sustained, unmanaged stress. And it's a business problem that impacts your bottom line.

Here’s how to move beyond vanity metrics and start tracking the *real* cost of engineering – burnout indicators.

## The Problem with Traditional Metrics

Let's be honest. Most of our metrics incentivize pushing harder. Story points can become a game of one-upmanship, where teams compete to estimate higher, not more accurately. Velocity becomes a target, not a measure of learning and adaptation. This creates a pressure cooker environment where individuals feel compelled to work longer hours, sacrifice work-life balance, and ultimately, burn out. 

The IEEE research, specifically a study on software development practices, highlighted this tension – it found that engineers are often *convinced* to believe in processes (story points, burndown charts) that may not actually be effective, adding to frustration and reducing motivation. Focusing solely on output ignores the input - the energy, creativity, and well-being of the team.

## Beyond the Numbers: Key Burnout Indicators

These aren’t metrics you’ll find in Jira. They require observation, empathy, and open communication. Consider this scenario: a previously proactive developer, Sarah, begins missing deadlines and her code reviews become superficial. She’s less engaged in team discussions and seems perpetually tired. These aren’t necessarily signs of incompetence; they could be indicators of burnout. Here's what to look for:

* **Increased Code Churn & Regression:** A sudden increase in rework, bug fixes for previously addressed issues, and a higher frequency of regressions are strong indicators. It suggests people are rushing, not reviewing carefully, and potentially cutting corners. (Think: more patches, more hotfixes.)
* **Shifting Communication Patterns:** Pay attention to *how* people communicate. Are they becoming shorter, more terse, or avoiding meetings? A significant drop in participation, or a change in tone, is a red flag. Also, look for a rise in negative language or cynicism.
* **Increased Context Switching:** Are individuals constantly being pulled onto unrelated tasks? Frequent interruptions and a lack of dedicated focus time are killers of productivity *and* contribute to mental fatigue. (This is especially true in organizations with poorly defined priorities.)
* **Decline in Code Review Quality:** Is the quality of code reviews slipping? Are reviewers providing superficial feedback, or simply rubber-stamping changes? This indicates a lack of mental bandwidth and a growing sense of apathy.
* **Increased Absenteeism and "Presenteeism":** Obvious, but important. Increased sick days are a clear signal. But also watch for “presenteeism” – people physically present but mentally checked out, working long hours without producing meaningful output. (This is often *more* damaging than absenteeism.)
* **The “Two or Three Times” Rule:** I’ve consistently observed a pattern. When someone repeatedly brings up a legitimate improvement idea that’s dismissed by leadership, they begin to disengage. It signals a lack of psychological safety and a feeling that their contributions aren’t valued. (This is about respect and empowerment, not just process.)

## Actionable Steps: From Observation to Intervention

Tracking these indicators isn't enough. You need to act on them. It’s also important to acknowledge that balancing delivery pressures with team wellbeing is *difficult* and leaders are often under pressure from above. 

* **Regular 1:1s Focused on Wellbeing:** Beyond project updates, dedicate a portion of your 1:1s to genuinely checking in with your team members. Ask open-ended questions about their workload, energy levels, and overall wellbeing. *Listen* more than you talk.
* **Prioritization and Scope Management:** Firmly prioritize tasks and be willing to say "no" to scope creep. Protect your team from unrealistic expectations and unnecessary distractions. (This requires difficult conversations with stakeholders, but it’s essential.)
* **Encourage and Model Boundaries:** Promote a culture that values work-life balance and respects personal time. *Lead by example* – don't send emails at all hours or expect immediate responses.
* **Promote Psychological Safety:** Create an environment where people feel comfortable speaking up, sharing ideas, and raising concerns without fear of retribution.
* **Empower Autonomy:** Give your team members more control over their work and allow them to make decisions. This fosters a sense of ownership and reduces feelings of helplessness.

## The “Producing vs. Consuming” Test

Jason Evanish, a leading expert in engineering leadership, emphasizes the importance of assessing whether teams are *producing* value or simply *consuming* energy and time. If your team is constantly firefighting, attending endless meetings, or chasing unrealistic goals, they’re likely consuming more than they’re producing.  This imbalance is a major contributor to burnout.

Burnout isn’t inevitable. By shifting our focus from *output* to *outcome*, and by actively monitoring the indicators of stress, we can create more sustainable, high-performing engineering teams – and build a culture that values the wellbeing of our people.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Prioritize Wellbeing:** Actively monitoring burnout indicators isn’t just about preventing problems; it’s about creating a sustainable, engaged team.
* **Focus on Outcome, Not Just Output:** Shifting the focus from sheer volume of work to meaningful results reduces pressure and fosters a healthier work environment.
* **Start Small:** Begin by incorporating a quick check-in on wellbeing into your 1:1s. This small step can make a big difference.
