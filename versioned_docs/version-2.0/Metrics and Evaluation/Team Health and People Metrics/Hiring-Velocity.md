# Hiring Velocity

For engineering leaders, the pressure to scale teams quickly is constant. We’re told to “move fast,” to “build, measure, learn,” and to capitalize on opportunities before competitors do. But often, the focus on *speed* in hiring eclipses the vital need for *quality*. This creates a dangerous dynamic. We end up with a high “velocity” – lots of hires happening quickly – but low impact. This isn't just inefficient; it actively *slows* down progress. Consider this: a recent study by Josh Bersin estimates the cost of a single bad hire can be as high as 30% of the new hire’s first-year salary. 

Let's explore Hiring Velocity: what it is, why it matters, how to measure it *effectively*, and how to optimize for both speed *and* quality.

## Beyond Time-to-Fill: Defining True Hiring Velocity

“Time-to-fill” is the metric most often cited when discussing hiring speed. It measures the number of days it takes to fill a position. While it’s a starting point, it’s a *terrible* sole indicator of hiring velocity. Why? Because it rewards simply filling seats, not filling them with the *right* people. 

Think of it like this: you can drive a car very fast, but if you're constantly swerving and crashing, you’re not actually making progress. 

**True Hiring Velocity is a combination of:**

* **Speed:** How quickly are we moving candidates through the pipeline? (Time-to-Fill is a component here).
* **Quality of Hire:** How well are new hires performing and contributing to team goals? (More on measuring this below).
* **Efficiency:** How much effort (recruiter time, engineering interview time) are we expending per hire?

**A useful formula to start thinking about this:**

**Hiring Velocity = (Number of Successful Hires) / (Total Recruiting & Interview Time + Cost)** 

This is a simplified view, and its limitations should be acknowledged. More sophisticated metrics, such as cost-per-hire adjusted for performance ratings, can provide a more nuanced understanding of hiring efficiency. However, this formula begins to emphasize that a high volume of *bad* hires doesn't equate to velocity.

## Why Does Hiring Velocity Matter *Specifically* for Engineering?

Engineering teams are unique. Technical skills are often highly specialized, and a mismatch in skillset or cultural fit can have a disproportionately negative impact. 

* **Ramp-Up Time:** A poorly matched engineer takes longer to become productive, impacting team output.
* **Technical Debt:** Incorrect skillsets can contribute to poor code quality and increased technical debt.
* **Team Morale:** Hiring someone who isn't a good fit disrupts team dynamics and can lead to frustration.
* **Increased Turnover:** Bad hires are more likely to leave quickly, restarting the costly hiring process.



## Measuring Quality of Hire: Beyond Gut Feeling

This is the trickiest part. “Quality” is subjective, but we need to move beyond relying on "gut feeling" during the interview process. Here are a few key indicators, grouped for clarity:

**Performance-Based Metrics:**

* **Performance Reviews:** Consistent positive performance reviews after 6, 12, and 18 months are crucial.
* **Project Completion Rate:** Are new hires consistently delivering on assigned projects?

**Contribution-Based Metrics:**

* **Code Contribution (for developers):** Track code commits, pull request acceptance rate, and code review feedback. 
* **360-Degree Feedback:** Gather input from peers, managers, and potentially even stakeholders to assess soft skills and collaboration.

**Retention-Based Metrics:**

* **Retention Rate:** Are they still with the company after a year? Turnover is a strong negative signal.

**Pro-Tip:** Establish these metrics *before* making hires. Define what "success" looks like upfront, so you have a clear basis for evaluation.



## Optimizing for Velocity *and* Quality: Practical Steps

So, how do you increase velocity without sacrificing quality? Here’s what I’ve found effective over the years:

1. **Refine Your Ideal Candidate Profile:** Be brutally honest about the skills and experience that are *absolutely* essential versus “nice-to-have.” This helps narrow the search and focus on the right candidates.
2. **Streamline the Interview Process:** Reduce the number of interview stages. Focus on behavioral and technical assessments that provide the most insight.
3. **Empower Hiring Managers:** Give engineering managers more ownership of the hiring process. They are best positioned to assess technical skills and cultural fit. Don’t let HR be a gatekeeper. *However, recognize that empowering hiring managers requires training, clear expectations, and a willingness to relinquish some control.*
4. **Invest in Assessment Tools:** Consider using coding challenges, skills assessments, and personality tests to objectively evaluate candidates.
5. **Prioritize Candidate Experience:** A positive candidate experience attracts top talent and reduces the risk of candidates dropping out of the process. Respond quickly, provide clear communication, and be respectful of their time.
6. **Build a Strong Employer Brand:** A positive reputation attracts more qualified candidates. Share your company culture, values, and engineering challenges to attract candidates who are a good fit.
7. **Don't Settle:** It's tempting to fill a critical role quickly, but hiring the wrong person is far more costly in the long run. Be patient and hold out for the best fit.



##  The Long Game: Sustainable Velocity

Hiring velocity isn’t about reaching a certain number of hires per month. It’s about building a high-performing engineering team that can consistently deliver value. 

Focus on building a robust, efficient hiring process, measuring quality *alongside* speed, and creating a culture that attracts and retains top talent. This isn't a sprint; it's a marathon.
