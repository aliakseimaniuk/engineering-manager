# Business Alignment Score

As engineering leaders, we often talk about building the *right* thing. But how do we *know* we're building the right thing? We meticulously gather requirements, prioritize features, and track velocity. Yet, despite our best efforts, projects sometimes launch to a lukewarm reception, or worse, flat-out fail to deliver the expected business value. 

Why does this happen? Often, it’s not a technical failing, but a *lack of alignment* between what engineering *thinks* the business needs and what the business *actually* needs. We get caught in the trap of solving interesting technical challenges without sufficient grounding in real customer problems and market realities. This isn't malice – it's often a consequence of operating with incomplete information and good intentions. But as the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with them.

Over the years, I’ve found a surprisingly simple metric, what I call the **Business Alignment Score (BAS)**, can drastically reduce the risk of this happening. It’s not about adding another complex KPI to track, but about fostering a shared understanding and proactively identifying potential misalignments *before* significant engineering effort is expended. This framework was initially inspired by lean startup principles and a desire to create a lightweight, cross-functional check-in process.

## What *is* the Business Alignment Score?

The BAS isn't a single number, but a qualitative assessment based on answering three key questions, rated on a simple scale of 1-5 (1 = Very Poor Alignment, 5 = Excellent Alignment).  Think of it as a quick “health check” before kicking off significant work. 

Here are the questions:

1. **Customer Problem Clarity:**  How well do we *truly* understand the customer problem this feature/project is solving?  (Not just *what* they asked for, but the underlying *why*.)
2. **Business Impact Quantification:** How clearly defined and measurable is the expected business impact of solving this problem? (e.g., revenue increase, cost reduction, customer retention, market share gain).
3. **Strategic Priority Confirmation:** How strongly does this project align with the overall company strategy and current priorities? (Is it a “must-do,” a “should-do,” or a “nice-to-have”?)

**Calculating the BAS:** Sum the scores from all three questions.  A score of 15 represents perfect alignment, while a score below 8 signals a serious risk of misalignment.

## Why This Works: Beyond the Numbers

The BAS isn’t about hitting a specific number; it’s about the *conversation* it sparks. The real value lies in forcing a cross-functional dialogue between product, engineering, and business stakeholders. 

Here's how it helps, based on my experience:

* **Exposes Assumptions:**  Question 1 forces us to dig deeper than surface-level feature requests. I've seen numerous projects nearly derail when a simple conversation revealed the initial assumption about the customer problem was completely wrong. For example, a recent project aimed to improve a user onboarding flow was nearly built on the incorrect assumption that users were dropping off due to technical difficulties. The BAS process revealed through questioning that the *real* issue was a lack of clear value proposition messaging.
* **Connects Effort to Outcome:** Question 2 compels us to move beyond "building cool stuff" to "building valuable stuff." It pushes stakeholders to articulate *how* success will be measured, clarifying expectations and setting realistic goals.
* **Prioritization Transparency:** Question 3 ensures engineering isn't unknowingly working on low-priority tasks while critical initiatives languish. It promotes a shared understanding of what truly matters to the business.

## Putting the BAS into Practice: A Simple Framework

Here’s how to implement the BAS in your team:

1. **Initial Assessment:** At the start of any significant project (e.g., new feature, major refactor), gather the relevant stakeholders for a brief alignment session.
2. **Score Each Question:**  Individually, each stakeholder rates each question on the 1-5 scale.
3. **Discuss Discrepancies:**  The facilitator (usually the engineering manager or product manager) highlights any significant discrepancies in the scores.  *This is the most important part!*  Encourage open discussion and debate to understand the reasons behind the differing perspectives.
4. **Action Plan:**  Based on the discussion, develop an action plan to address any identified misalignment. This might involve further customer research, refining the business case, or adjusting project priorities.
5. **Revisit as Needed:**  The BAS isn’t a one-time exercise. Revisit the assessment periodically (e.g., during sprint planning, after key milestones) to ensure continued alignment.

Consider using a simple grid like the one below to capture individual scores during your alignment session.

| Question                        | Stakeholder 1 | Stakeholder 2 | Stakeholder 3 |
|---------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Customer Problem Clarity         |       4       |       2       |       3       |
| Business Impact Quantification |       3       |       5       |       4       |
| Strategic Priority Confirmation|       5       |       4       |       5       |

## What This Won’t Solve

The BAS is a powerful tool for *identifying* potential misalignment, but it’s not a silver bullet. It’s not a substitute for thorough requirements gathering, robust prioritization processes, or ongoing communication. Think of it as an *early warning system* that complements your existing workflows.

## From “Bad Luck” to Intentional Outcomes

As engineering leaders, we're often tasked with building complex systems. But sometimes, the most impactful thing we can do is create a simple framework that fosters clarity, alignment, and intentionality.  The Business Alignment Score is one such framework. 

It's not a silver bullet, but it's a surprisingly effective way to prevent "good intentions" from becoming "bad luck" and ensures that our engineering efforts consistently deliver real business value. Ultimately, delivering real business value is the key objective. 

We encourage you to implement the BAS in your next project kickoff and experience the benefits of increased alignment firsthand.
