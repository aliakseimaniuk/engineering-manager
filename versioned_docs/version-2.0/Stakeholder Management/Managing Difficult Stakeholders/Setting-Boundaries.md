# Setting Boundaries

Stakeholder management. It’s a phrase that often conjures images of polite negotiation and carefully worded emails. And while those things are *part* of it, a crucial, often overlooked component is something far more foundational: **setting boundaries.** 

As engineering leaders, we’re inherently builders. We build products, we build teams, and we often find ourselves building bridges – trying to accommodate *everyone’s* requests. This desire to be helpful, to be “yes” people, feels good in the short term. But consistently overextending ourselves, and our teams, erodes velocity, breeds resentment, and ultimately harms our ability to deliver.

I remember one instance where a stakeholder requested a new reporting feature just before a critical release. Implementing it would have meant delaying the launch by a week, impacting several dependent teams. Navigating that conversation was challenging, but ultimately, protecting the release timeline was the right decision. Learning to build that "invisible shield" of healthy boundaries isn’t about being difficult. It’s about being *effective*.

## Why Boundaries Matter: Beyond Just Saying "No"

Saying "no" *is* part of it, yes. But healthy boundaries are far more nuanced. They aren’t about blocking communication; they’re about *defining the terms of engagement*. They're about:

* **Protecting Focus:** Constant context switching is a velocity killer. Boundaries shield your team from distractions that pull them away from committed work.
* **Managing Expectations:** Clearly defining what you *can* and *cannot* deliver prevents unrealistic promises and subsequent disappointment.
* **Preventing Burnout:** Overcommitment leads to stressed teams and high turnover. Boundaries are essential for a sustainable pace – and contribute to improved team morale and reduced stress levels.
* **Cultivating Trust:** Ironically, *strong* boundaries build trust. Stakeholders respect leaders who are honest about capacity and priorities.
* **Demonstrating Value:** By saying “no” to things that don’t align with strategic goals, you’re showcasing what *does* matter and reinforcing the team’s priorities.

## Practical Strategies for Boundary Setting

Okay, theory is great. But how do you *actually* set boundaries? Here's a framework I've found useful, broken down by common scenarios:

**1. The "Quick Favor" Request:** This is the most common culprit. A stakeholder asks for a "small" change that will "only take a few hours."

* **Response Template:** “That sounds interesting. Let me take a look at the current sprint commitments and priorities. I'll get back to you by [time/day] with a realistic assessment of how this fits in.” 
* **Key:** *Don’t commit on the spot.* This buys you time to assess the impact. If it *does* fit, great! If not, you've already established a process for evaluating requests.

**2. Scope Creep:** The ever-expanding feature list.

* **Strategy:** Implement a change request process. All new requests should be formally documented, estimated, and prioritized against existing work.
* **Communication:** “We’re committed to delivering [original scope] by [date]. This new request would impact that timeline. Let’s discuss how we can best incorporate it – either by adjusting the scope, timeline, or resources.”

**3. Unrealistic Deadlines:** The "we need this yesterday!" scenario.

* **Approach:** "I understand the urgency. Let’s break down the work into smaller, achievable milestones. I’ll provide a realistic timeline based on the complexity of the task and the team’s current commitments."
* **Don't be afraid to negotiate.** Explain the technical tradeoffs of rushing a feature. 

**4. Constant Interruptions (Meetings, Slack Messages):** This erodes deep work.

* **Implement "Focus Time".** Block out dedicated hours on the team calendar where engineers are shielded from meetings and non-urgent communication.
* **Encourage Asynchronous Communication.** Leverage tools like documentation, shared notes, and well-defined issue trackers to reduce the need for constant back-and-forth.

## The Art of Saying "No" (And Why It's Not Rude)

Let’s be honest, saying “no” is hard. We fear appearing unhelpful or inflexible. But remember this: **saying "no" to the *wrong* things allows you to say "yes" to the *right* things.** 

* **Frame it Positively:** "While I'm not able to take on that request at this time, I’m happy to [offer alternative solution/point them to another resource]."
* **Explain Your Reasoning (Briefly):** “We're currently focused on [priority project] to ensure we deliver a high-quality product on time.”
* **Be Firm and Direct:** Avoid hedging or apologizing excessively. A clear, concise “no” is more respectful than a rambling excuse.



## It's a Muscle, Not a Switch

Setting boundaries isn’t a one-time event. It’s an ongoing practice, a muscle you need to strengthen over time. There will be pushback. Stakeholders will test your limits. But by consistently upholding your boundaries, you’ll earn respect, protect your team, and ultimately deliver more value. It requires consistent effort and clear communication, but the long-term benefits are well worth it. 

**To start, identify one boundary you will begin setting this week.** Perhaps it’s blocking off dedicated focus time, implementing a change request process, or simply being more direct when declining requests that don’t align with priorities. By consistently upholding your boundaries, you’ll not only protect your team but also foster a culture of trust, respect, and sustainable productivity.
