# Expectation Management

Nearly 70% of projects fail due to unrealistic expectations and poor communication. As an engineering manager, you’re likely familiar with the sinking feeling when a project derails not because of *technical* difficulties, but because of a disconnect between what was promised and what’s actually achievable. For over 20 years, I’ve seen this happen repeatedly. It’s rarely about *telling* people what can't be done; it’s about proactively shaping *how* they understand what *is* possible, and setting a realistic path forward. This isn’t about saying “no” all the time (though sometimes that's necessary!). It’s about thoughtful, consistent communication – a skill that separates good leaders from great ones.

We operate in a world of inherent uncertainty. Estimating timelines is notoriously difficult. Technical debt looms. Unexpected bugs appear. Unlike some other departments where promises can be more concrete, our deliverables are often based on *estimates*. This demands a nuanced approach to expectation management, one that acknowledges this uncertainty and builds in buffers for the inevitable surprises.

I once inherited a team working on a critical feature for a major product launch. I walked into a meeting where the PM confidently stated, “We *need* this feature shipped by the 15th to hit our marketing window!” When I dug into the details, it became clear the timeline was based on optimistic estimates and a lack of understanding of the underlying complexity. The team was already working overtime, morale was plummeting, and the feature was shaping up to be a buggy mess. The problem wasn’t a lack of effort; it was a broken promise built on unrealistic expectations. The fix required a difficult conversation, a revised timeline, and a commitment to transparent communication.

## A Framework for Proactive Expectation Management

Here's a framework I've found helpful, built around three key phases: **Set Clear Expectations, Communicate Progress, and Adapt to Change.**

**1. Set Clear Expectations: The "What" and the "How"**

* **Understand the 'Why':** Before diving into technical details, truly understand *why* a feature or project is important. Knowing the business rationale will help you prioritize and make informed trade-offs.
* **Break Down the Work:** Decompose the project into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes estimation more accurate and allows for clearer progress tracking.
* **Estimation with Ranges, Not Points:** Forget striving for precise estimates. Provide ranges (“We estimate this will take between 5-7 days”) instead of single points. This acknowledges inherent uncertainty. Consider using story points with velocity tracking, but even those are still estimates.
* **Identify Dependencies and Risks:** Proactively surface potential roadblocks. Are there external APIs you rely on? Are there known technical challenges? Document these openly.
* **Be Upfront About Trade-offs:** Transparency builds trust. Be clear about the implications of different choices: "We can deliver this feature quickly, but it will mean sacrificing scalability," or "Implementing this perfectly will take longer and cost more."

**2. Communicate Progress: Transparency is Key**

* **Regular Updates:** Don't wait for status meetings. Provide frequent, concise updates on progress, roadblocks, and any changes to the timeline. Short daily stand-ups are invaluable.
* **Visual Progress Tracking:** Use tools like Jira, Trello, or even a simple spreadsheet to visually represent progress. A burndown chart can be a powerful way to show how work is being completed.

* **Be Honest About Challenges:** Don't sugarcoat problems. If something is going wrong, communicate it immediately. Acknowledge the impact and propose solutions.
* **Active Listening:** Truly listen to concerns from stakeholders. Understand their priorities and address them thoughtfully.
* **Document Everything:** Keep a record of all key decisions, estimates, and agreements. This provides a single source of truth and prevents misunderstandings.

**3. Adapt to Change: Flexibility is Essential**

* **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular check-ins with stakeholders to review progress, discuss any changes, and reassess priorities.
* **Be Willing to Re-Negotiate:** Things change. Requirements evolve. Be prepared to re-negotiate timelines and scope as needed. A collaborative approach is crucial.
* **Post-Mortems:** After a project is completed, conduct a post-mortem to identify what went well, what didn't, and how to improve the process for future projects. This is a valuable learning opportunity.

## Beyond Just Saying "No"

I was reminded of a quote recently, from "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt: “The ability to see the long-run consequences of present policies is the key to statesmanship.” This applies perfectly to expectation management. We, as engineering leaders, need to anticipate potential issues, communicate them proactively, and shape expectations to ensure long-term success.

It's not about simply saying “no” to requests. It’s about framing the conversation, offering alternative solutions, and building a shared understanding of what’s realistically achievable. It requires a commitment to transparency, communication, and a willingness to adapt. 

By mastering the art of expectation management, you’ll not only deliver successful projects but also build a team that is motivated, engaged, and trusted by stakeholders across the organization.
