# Regular Updates

For two decades, I’ve seen engineering teams build incredible things. But equally as often, I've seen good work suffer – not from technical flaws, but from a lack of trust with stakeholders. And consistently, the root of that distrust? Inconsistent or absent communication. A staggering 57% of projects fail due to poor communication – a statistic that underscores the critical importance of proactive stakeholder engagement. As engineering managers, we often focus on *what* we build, but rarely prioritize *how* we talk about it. This post is about why regular updates aren't just "nice to have," they're fundamental to stakeholder management and a healthy engineering culture.

## Beyond Status Reports: The Problem with Reactive Communication

Too often, “updates” feel like a chore – a reactive response to stakeholder inquiries or a begrudgingly completed status report. “What’s the status of Feature X?” forces an immediate response, but it doesn't *build* a relationship. It signals a lack of proactivity and puts stakeholders in a position of having to *hunt* for information. This creates anxiety and undermines confidence in your team.

I learned this the hard way early in my career. I was leading a small team building a critical component for a larger platform. We hit a snag, a tricky integration issue. I figured, “Let’s fix it, then tell them.” Bad move. By the time I communicated the delay, stakeholders felt blindsided. The issue wasn't the delay itself (things *always* slip), it was the lack of foresight and transparency. I’d missed opportunities to manage expectations *before* things went sideways.

## The Power of a Consistent Rhythm

The solution isn't to over-communicate every minor detail. It's about establishing a predictable *rhythm* of communication. Think of it like a heartbeat: regular and reassuring.  Implementing this rhythm can be challenging, especially for teams already stretched thin, but the benefits to stakeholder trust are well worth the effort. Here's what that looks like in practice:

* **Weekly Summary:** A short (think 5-10 minutes read) email or Slack update outlining:
    * **What we completed this week:** Showcase wins, big or small.
    * **What we're working on next week:** Provide a clear roadmap.
    * **Blockers or Risks:** Be honest about challenges *before* they become crises. 
    * **Key Metrics (where appropriate):** Show progress against agreed-upon goals (e.g., bug resolution rate, feature completion percentage).
* **Monthly Deep Dive:** A longer meeting (30-60 minutes) for a more detailed discussion, including demos, Q&A, and strategic alignment. This is where you can surface more complex issues and solicit feedback.
* **"In-Flight" Notifications (Strategic Use):** Don't flood stakeholders, but proactively flag significant changes or risks *as they emerge*. A quick heads-up is far better than a surprise later.


## Why This Works: The Psychology of Trust

Consistent updates aren’t about being overly bureaucratic. They tap into fundamental psychological needs:

* **Control & Predictability:** Knowing what’s happening (even if it’s not always perfect) reduces anxiety.
* **Respect:** Proactively sharing information shows you value stakeholders’ time and input.
* **Transparency:** Open communication builds credibility and fosters a sense of partnership.
* **Shared Understanding:** Regular discussions ensure everyone is aligned on priorities and goals.

## Beyond the "What": Focus on the "Why"

Don't just report *what* you’re doing; explain *why*. Connect your team’s work to the broader business objectives. Show how your efforts contribute to the company's success. This is particularly crucial when explaining delays or setbacks.  

For example, instead of saying, “Feature X is delayed due to a technical issue,” try, “We encountered an unexpected challenge with Feature X that requires us to refactor a key component. While this will delay delivery by two days, it will result in a more robust and scalable solution in the long run.” 

But it’s not just about damage control. I once led a team building a new recommendation engine. We encountered a performance bottleneck that forced us to significantly reduce the scope of the initial release. Instead of framing it as a failure, we proactively explained to stakeholders how this focused approach would allow us to deliver a *more valuable* core experience faster, and then iterate rapidly on additional features. They were initially disappointed about the reduced scope, but ultimately appreciated our transparency and commitment to delivering a high-quality product. This turned a potentially negative situation into a positive demonstration of agility and customer focus. 

## Tailoring Your Approach

One size doesn’t fit all. The frequency and format of your communication should be adapted to your stakeholders’ needs and preferences. Some prefer detailed written updates, while others prefer quick verbal check-ins. Be adaptable and willing to adjust your communication style accordingly.  

Finally, *ask for feedback*. Are your updates helpful? Are they the right length? Are there any topics they’d like you to cover? Showing a willingness to listen and improve will further strengthen your relationships.

## Conclusion: Invest in the Rhythm

Regular updates aren’t just a task to check off your list. They’re a strategic investment in stakeholder trust and a cornerstone of effective engineering management. By establishing a predictable rhythm of communication, you can reduce anxiety, foster collaboration, and build a stronger, more resilient team. It takes effort, but establishing this rhythm and the resulting confidence and smoother path to success are well worth it. 

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Proactive Communication is Key:** Don't wait for stakeholders to ask for updates.
*   **Focus on the "Why":** Connect your work to broader business objectives.
*   **Tailor Your Approach:** Adapt your communication style to individual stakeholder preferences.
*   **Be Transparent:** Honesty and openness build trust and credibility.
