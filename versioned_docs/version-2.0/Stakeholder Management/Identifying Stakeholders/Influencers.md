# Influencers

For engineering leaders, “stakeholder management” often conjures images of product managers, designers, and maybe even sales VPs. But increasingly, a new type of stakeholder is demanding our attention: the “influencer.” And managing them isn’t about chasing vanity metrics – it’s about understanding their power, mitigating risks, and leveraging that power responsibly. 

I’ve seen this shift firsthand, from early days at a startup where a single prominent blogger could make or break a launch, to leading larger teams where “developer relations” and community building are now essential functions. This article isn’t about *becoming* an influencer; it's about how to *manage* them as a leader responsible for delivery.

## The Shifting Landscape: Why Influencers Matter to Engineering

Traditionally, engineering credibility was built on technical merit – peer-reviewed code, well-documented APIs, robust testing. That’s still vital, but it’s no longer *sufficient*. Today, perception plays a huge role.  The speed of innovation and the rise of open-source have amplified the voices of independent experts, making their opinions critically important.

Here's why:

* **Accelerated Adoption:** Influencers can dramatically speed up the adoption of new technologies or platforms. A positive review or tutorial from a trusted source carries far more weight than traditional advertising.
* **Early Feedback & Bug Discovery:**  A technically savvy influencer poking around your pre-release software can uncover critical bugs and usability issues before they hit a wider audience.
* **Shaping the Narrative:**  Influencers can help frame the conversation around your technology, highlighting its strengths and addressing potential weaknesses.
* **Developer Advocacy:** Some influencers actively build integrations, tools, and content *around* your platform, effectively extending your engineering resources.

However, this influence comes with risks.  Ignoring key influencers can be just as damaging as mismanaging them, potentially leading to negative sentiment spreading unchecked or missed opportunities for constructive feedback. A negative review, a misunderstanding of your technology, or even an unintentional misrepresentation can quickly damage your reputation.



## Beyond the Follower Count: Identifying *Real* Influence

Don’t fall into the trap of equating follower count with genuine influence.  A large following doesn't necessarily translate to technical expertise or credible opinions.  As an engineering leader, focus on these key characteristics:

* **Technical Depth:** Do they *understand* the underlying technology? Can they articulate its strengths and weaknesses intelligently?  Look beyond surface-level demos.  To assess technical depth, look for influencers who regularly contribute to technical blogs, participate in open-source projects, or present at industry conferences.
* **Audience Relevance:** Is their audience the *right* audience for your technology? A lifestyle influencer with millions of followers isn't going to move the needle for a niche developer tool.
* **Authenticity & Trust:**  Do they have a reputation for honesty and objectivity?  Influencers who shill every product that comes their way quickly lose credibility.
* **Engagement Rate:**  Pay attention to comments, shares, and other forms of engagement. A high engagement rate suggests a genuinely active and responsive audience.


## A Framework for Managing Influencer Relationships

Here's a practical approach, drawing from my experience building relationships with both individual developers and larger communities:

1. **Identify & Prioritize:**  Conduct research to identify key influencers in your space. Prioritize those who align with your technology and target audience.
2. **Engage Authentically & Provide Early Access:** Don’t treat influencers like marketing targets. Start by genuinely engaging with their content, offering thoughtful comments, and building a rapport. Demonstrating respect through early access to pre-release software, documentation, and engineering support is a natural extension of this engagement.
3. **Establish Clear Communication Channels:**  Create a dedicated channel for communication, whether it’s a Slack channel, email list, or regular video calls.  
4. **Be Transparent & Honest:**  Don't try to hide bugs or gloss over limitations. Be upfront about the challenges and work collaboratively to find solutions.  
5. **Respect Their Independence:**  Avoid overly restrictive NDAs or demands for positive reviews.  Genuine endorsements are far more valuable than forced ones. 

## Avoiding the Pitfalls: Managing Risk and Maintaining Credibility

It's crucial to remember that influencers are, well, *people*. Their opinions are subjective, and they’re not always right. Here are a few risks to watch out for:

* **Misinformation:**  Influencers may misunderstand your technology or misrepresent its capabilities.
* **Bias:**  They may have hidden agendas or be influenced by competitors.
* **Damage Control:**  A negative review or public criticism can quickly go viral.

To mitigate these risks:

* **Monitor Social Media:**  Keep a close eye on what influencers are saying about your technology.
* **Respond to Criticism Promptly & Professionally:**  Address concerns openly and honestly.
* **Don't Be Afraid to Disagree:**  If an influencer misrepresents your technology, politely but firmly correct the record. 
* **Remember Your Values:** As Wasserman highlights, long-term trust is built on solid foundations. Don't compromise your engineering principles for short-term gains. Some leaders may be skeptical of influencer marketing altogether, but remember that building genuine relationships with experts can provide invaluable feedback and accelerate adoption.



## Conclusion:  From "Vanity Metrics" to Value Creation

Managing influencers isn't about chasing likes and followers. It's about building authentic relationships with credible voices who can amplify your message, provide valuable feedback, and accelerate the adoption of your technology. 

By approaching influencer relationships strategically and ethically, you can transform a potential risk into a powerful asset for your engineering team and your organization. Start by identifying three key influencers in your space and begin engaging with their content today. And ultimately, that's what effective stakeholder management is all about.
