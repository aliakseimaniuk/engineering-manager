# Networking Strategies

As engineering managers, we often focus intensely on *internal* networks – the connections within our teams, across engineering, and with product. That’s crucial. But neglecting the *external* network – the relationships you build *outside* your immediate organization – can severely limit your growth, your team’s success, and even your ability to attract and retain top talent.

I remember a time when a critical scaling issue threatened to derail a major product launch. After exhausting internal resources, I reached out to a former colleague at a different company. She’d faced a similar challenge months earlier and, after a quick call, pointed me toward a solution we hadn’t considered. It saved the launch. This experience underscored the power of a strong external network.

This isn’t about collecting LinkedIn connections or attending every conference. It’s about building *strategic* relationships that provide value beyond a simple exchange of information. Over 20 years, I’ve seen firsthand how strong external networks can be a lifeline during crises, a source of innovative ideas, and a powerful engine for career advancement. Here's how to approach it, moving beyond the superficial to build genuinely valuable connections.

## Why External Networking Matters *Especially* for Engineering Leaders

Let's be honest, engineering often attracts introverts. Networking can *feel* transactional and uncomfortable. But consider this:

* **Problem Solving:** You *will* encounter problems your team hasn’t seen before. A strong network provides access to a wider pool of knowledge and experience. That seemingly impossible scaling issue? Someone in your network may have already solved it. A recent study by Harvard Business Review showed that managers with active external networks are 22% more likely to find innovative solutions to complex problems.
* **Staying Current:** Technology moves at breakneck speed. Networking helps you stay abreast of the latest trends, tools, and best practices – often before they hit the mainstream.
* **Talent Acquisition:** The competition for engineering talent is fierce. Your network can be your most effective recruiting channel. Referrals from trusted connections are far more valuable than cold applications.
* **Influence & Advocacy:** Building relationships with peers at other companies positions you as a thought leader and can open doors to collaboration, partnerships, and advocacy for your team’s work.
* **Personal & Career Growth:** Exposure to different perspectives and approaches broadens your horizons and helps you develop as a leader.

## Building Your Strategic Network: A Framework

Here’s a practical approach, broken down into phases:

**1. Identify Your "Networking Needs" (The "Why")**

Before you start adding connections, ask yourself:

* **What challenges are you currently facing?** (e.g., scaling a specific technology, adopting a new methodology, improving team velocity)
* **What areas do you want to learn more about?** (e.g., serverless architecture, machine learning, leading remote teams)
* **Who is already doing what you aspire to do?** (Identify individuals and companies you admire.)

This isn’t about needing something *from* people immediately. It’s about pinpointing areas where connections could provide value over the long term.

**2. Focus on Quality, Not Quantity**

Forget the “collect as many connections as possible” mentality. A handful of deep, meaningful relationships are far more valuable than hundreds of superficial ones. Prioritize connecting with:

* **Peers at similar companies:** You can exchange best practices and learn from each other’s experiences without competitive pressure.
* **Leaders at companies you admire:** Learn from their successes and challenges.
* **Experts in your field:** Seek out individuals who are recognized authorities in areas you’re interested in.
* **Individuals with different perspectives:** Don't just network with people who think like you. Diverse viewpoints are crucial for innovation.

**3. Provide Value First (The “Give” Before the “Ask”)**

Networking isn’t about what you can *get* from others; it’s about what you can *offer*.

* **Share your knowledge:** Write blog posts, speak at conferences, or mentor junior engineers.
* **Offer help:** If you recognize a challenge someone is facing that you’ve successfully navigated, offer your help.
* **Connect others:** Introduce people in your network who could benefit from knowing each other.
* **Be a good listener:** Truly listen to what others have to say and show genuine interest in their work.

**4. Leverage Tools & Platforms (But Don't Rely on Them Exclusively)**

Platforms like LinkedIn are useful for finding and connecting with people, but they shouldn’t be your only networking channel.  

* **Meetups & Conferences:** Attend industry events to meet people in person. (Remember, a quick chat at a conference can be far more valuable than months of online interaction).
* **Online Communities:** Participate in forums, Slack channels, and other online communities related to your field.
* **Internal Networks:** Don’t forget the power of networking *within* your organization. Build relationships with colleagues in other departments.

**5. Nurture Your Relationships**

Networking isn’t a one-time effort. It requires ongoing maintenance.

* **Regular Check-ins:** Send a quick email or message every few months to see how things are going.
* **Share Relevant Content:** If you come across an article or resource that you think someone would find helpful, share it with them.
* **Celebrate Successes:** Congratulate people on their accomplishments.
* **Be a Reliable Resource:** Follow through on your commitments and be someone people can count on.

## How Emerging Tech Can Enhance Your Network

While classic networking holds strong, several emerging technologies can create new avenues for connection and deepen existing relationships.

* **Virtual Events & Communities:** Beyond webinars, platforms are fostering deeper, ongoing interaction, allowing for focused discussions and knowledge sharing.
* **Decentralized Web Hosting (like dAppling Network):** These platforms can create communities around specific technologies, enabling collaboration and connection among practitioners.
* **Socket as a Service (like Mirna Sockets):** Facilitates real-time communication and collaboration within niche communities, allowing for quick problem-solving and knowledge exchange.
* **Tools for Remote Collaboration (like Radmin VPN):** While designed for IT management, these tools can enable more direct, "LAN-like" collaboration with remote peers, fostering a sense of immediacy and connection.

**Final Thoughts:**

Strategic networking is a long-term investment. It takes time, effort, and genuine connection. But the benefits – increased knowledge, access to talent, and a stronger position as a leader – are well worth the effort. Don't think of it as "networking." Think of it as building genuine relationships with people you respect and admire.

**Take Action:** This week, identify one person outside your organization who you admire and reach out to connect. Send a personalized message expressing your interest in their work and suggesting a brief virtual coffee chat.  That's a strategy that will pay dividends throughout your career.
