# Long Term Relationship Management

For engineering managers, “stakeholder management” often feels like a transactional exercise. We gather requirements, deliver updates, manage expectations… but does that truly build *relationships*? I've seen firsthand how a shift from simply *managing* stakeholders to cultivating long-term partnerships can be the difference between project success and frustrating delays. In my 20+ years leading engineering teams, I’ve learned this isn't about tools or processes – it's about genuine investment in mutual success.

We obsess over sprints and roadmaps, but often overlook the people who will ultimately determine if those efforts matter. This isn’t a “soft skill” add-on; it’s foundational to delivering impactful work and building a sustainable engineering culture. Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between positive stakeholder relationships and project outcomes, including faster time-to-market and increased customer satisfaction [Citation: Consider researching and adding a relevant study here, e.g., from the Project Management Institute].

## The Cost of Transactional Stakeholder Management

Think about a recent project where stakeholder communication felt… strained. Perhaps requirements were misunderstood, feedback was delayed, or decisions felt arbitrary. Chances are, a purely transactional approach was at play. This manifests in several ways:

* **Increased Friction:** Constant negotiation and clarification drain energy and slow down progress.
* **Reduced Innovation:** Stakeholders are less likely to share bold ideas if they don't trust you to understand and champion them.
* **Erosion of Trust:** Repeatedly treating stakeholders as requirement-generators rather than partners creates distance and resentment.
* **Higher Turnover:** A toxic stakeholder relationship can impact the team’s morale, ultimately leading to engineers leaving.

I’ve seen this firsthand. I once worked with a product manager who was brilliant technically, but lacked the ability to build rapport. He’d approach conversations like interrogations, focusing solely on what *he* needed. The result? His team consistently delivered *what* was asked, but rarely went the extra mile. Morale plummeted, and the quality of work suffered. He was a technically gifted individual, but frankly, not a manager who fostered positive relationships.

## Shifting from Management to Relationship-Building

So, how do we move beyond transactions and build lasting relationships with our stakeholders? Here's a framework based on three key principles:

**1. Understand Their World:**

This goes beyond understanding their immediate needs. Take the time to learn about their challenges, their priorities, and what success looks like *from their perspective*.

* **Regular 1:1s (Beyond Status Updates):** Don't just talk about project progress. Ask about their biggest frustrations, their long-term goals, and how your team can help.
* **Contextual Inquiry:** If possible, spend time observing how they work. This can reveal hidden pain points and opportunities for collaboration.
* **Active Listening:** Really *hear* what they're saying, not just waiting for your turn to speak.

**Transition:** Truly understanding your stakeholders sets the stage for open and proactive communication, which is crucial for building trust and avoiding misunderstandings.

**2. Proactive Communication & Transparency:**

Don’t wait for them to come to you with questions or concerns. Be proactive in sharing information, even when it's not perfect.

* **“Pre-Briefs” Before Meetings:** Send a quick summary of what you plan to cover, giving them time to prepare and formulate questions.
* **Early Issue Escalation:** Communicate potential roadblocks or delays as early as possible, along with potential solutions.
* **Share Context, Not Just Results:** Explain *why* certain decisions were made, even if they’re not immediately popular.

I remember a situation where a critical feature was delayed due to unforeseen technical complexity. Instead of hiding the issue, I proactively informed the stakeholders, explained the problem, and outlined a revised plan. While they were initially disappointed, they appreciated the transparency and were more willing to collaborate on a solution.  I've also found this approach builds trust with stakeholders outside of product - like marketing or sales - who often need to prepare communication to customers.

**Transition:**  Understanding and open communication lay the foundation for a final crucial element: a shared focus on achieving mutual success.

**3. Focus on Mutual Success:**

This is where authentic concern comes in. Instead of viewing stakeholders as obstacles to overcome, see them as partners in achieving a common goal.

* **Seek Their Input Early and Often:** Involve them in the decision-making process, even for seemingly minor issues.
* **Celebrate Wins Together:** Acknowledge their contributions to the team's success.
* **Be a Reliable Resource:** Be available to answer their questions and provide support.

Building these relationships isn’t limited to internal stakeholders. I worked with a customer support manager who regularly connected with engineering to understand upcoming changes. This allowed her team to proactively prepare documentation and training, resulting in a smoother rollout and happier customers.

## The Long Game and Making it Work

Building long-term relationships with stakeholders isn't always easy. It requires effort, empathy, and a willingness to invest in people. It also requires recognizing that many managers are already overloaded. This isn't about adding more meetings, but about making existing interactions more meaningful. By prioritizing relationships, we can create a more fulfilling and impactful work experience for everyone involved.

## Actionable Steps

Here are a few concrete steps you can take *this week* to start building stronger relationships with your stakeholders:

1. **Schedule a 1:1 with a key stakeholder:** Focus the conversation on *their* challenges and how your team can help.
2. **Proactively share a project update:** Don't just report on progress; explain the *why* behind your decisions.
3. **Actively listen in your next meeting:** Resist the urge to interrupt and truly hear what your stakeholders are saying.

Ultimately, software is built by people, for people. By prioritizing relationships, we can create a more fulfilling and impactful work experience for everyone involved. And after 30 years in IT, that's a goal truly worth striving for.
