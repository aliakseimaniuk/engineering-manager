# Trust Building

Trust. It's a word thrown around a lot, especially in leadership circles. But beyond the buzzword, it’s the essential lubricant that keeps teams moving, unlocks innovation, and allows engineering organizations to actually *deliver* on ambitious goals. Consider the cost of *lost* productivity due to lack of trust – delays, rework, and diminished morale – and you quickly see why it's so critical. As engineering leaders, we aren't just managing code; we're managing relationships – with our teams, with product, with design, and with the wider business. And those relationships are built, or broken, on trust.

I’ve seen firsthand how a lack of trust can cripple a project. Years ago, I inherited a team where previous management had fostered a culture of blame and micromanagement. Every decision was second-guessed, risks weren't taken, and the team was consistently delivering late and underperforming. The impact was clear: missed deadlines, a frustrated team, and a product riddled with bugs. It wasn’t a technical problem; it was a trust problem. Rebuilding that foundation took months, and frankly, we lost good people along the way. 

This isn't about being *liked*. It’s about *demonstrating* reliability. And in the context of stakeholder management, it's about consistently demonstrating competence, integrity, and a genuine commitment to shared success. 

## Why Trust is Especially Critical for Engineering Leaders

Engineering, by its nature, involves complexity and risk. Things *will* go wrong. Estimates will be inaccurate. Bugs will slip through. The difference between a manageable setback and a full-blown crisis often comes down to the level of trust you’ve built. 

When trust is high, teams are more likely to proactively identify problems early, allowing for swift intervention. Innovation thrives when people feel safe experimenting and pushing boundaries. Constructive criticism is embraced as an opportunity for improvement, rather than perceived as a personal attack. And even when stakeholders don’t fully agree with a decision, they understand that you’re making it with the best available information and with the organization’s best interests at heart.

Think about the inherent friction between engineering and other departments like product or marketing. Product wants fast iteration; engineering wants technical rigor. Marketing wants bold promises; engineering wants realistic timelines. Without trust, these tensions escalate into conflict. *With* trust, you can navigate these differences, find common ground, and deliver a quality product that satisfies everyone. Psychological safety, a key component of trust, has been shown to significantly impact team performance and innovation (Edmondson, 1999).

## Practical Strategies for Building Trust

Okay, enough theory. Here’s how to actively cultivate trust as an engineering leader:

**1. Lead with Competence (and Humility):**

This one seems obvious, but it's critical. You don’t need to be the *best* engineer on the team, but you *do* need to demonstrate a solid understanding of the technology and the challenges your team faces. Be willing to admit when you don’t know something and actively seek input from your team. Authenticity goes a long way. For example, I once had to admit to my team I was unfamiliar with a new cloud service they were proposing. By being open about my knowledge gap and inviting their expertise, I not only earned their respect but also learned a valuable new skill.

**2. Be Radically Transparent (Within Reason):**

Share information openly and honestly. Explain *why* decisions are made, even if they're unpopular. Don’t hide problems or sugarcoat bad news. However, transparency doesn’t mean oversharing confidential information. Know where the boundaries lie. Regularly communicate project status, risks, and dependencies to all stakeholders. 

**3. Consistently Deliver on Your Commitments:**

This is where reliability comes in. If you say you’re going to do something, *do it*. If you can't, be upfront about it and explain why. Under-promise and over-deliver whenever possible. This builds a reputation for dependability. I've found that consistently meeting deadlines, even small ones, demonstrates a commitment to follow-through that builds trust over time.

**4. Champion Your Team (Especially When It's Hard):** 

Protect your team from unreasonable demands and unrealistic expectations. Advocate for the resources they need to succeed. Publicly acknowledge their accomplishments and celebrate their wins. If mistakes happen, focus on learning from them rather than assigning blame. During a particularly challenging sprint, I shielded my team from a last-minute feature request from marketing, explaining to stakeholders that adding it would jeopardize the existing commitments and impact quality.

**5. Actively Listen and Seek Feedback:**

Make a conscious effort to understand the perspectives of others. Ask open-ended questions and truly listen to the answers. Solicit feedback on your own performance and be willing to act on it. Show genuine curiosity and a willingness to learn. I regularly conduct one-on-one meetings with my team members, specifically focusing on understanding their challenges and gathering their input on how I can better support them.

**6. Embrace Vulnerability:**

This is perhaps the hardest one. Share your own challenges and mistakes. Admit when you’ve made a bad call. This demonstrates humility and builds a connection with your team. It shows them that you’re human, just like them. Sharing a past failure and the lessons learned can be far more impactful than presenting yourself as someone who always has the answer.

## Trust is an Investment, Not an Expense

Building trust takes time and effort. There are no shortcuts. But the payoff is enormous. A team built on trust is more innovative, more resilient, and more capable of achieving great things. 

I often think back to a saying I recall reading regarding the importance of a strong foundation: "You do not measure the water in the well by drinking it, but by building the well." (Source currently being researched). Trust is like that well. Invest in building it, and you’ll have a source of strength and resilience that will serve you and your team for years to come.
