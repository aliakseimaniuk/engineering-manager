# Encouraging Work Life Balance

For two decades, I’ve watched the definition of “work-life balance” get tossed around like a hot potato. It implies a perfect equilibrium, a 50/50 split. That’s… unrealistic. Especially now, with the blurring lines of remote work. We’re not aiming for balance; we're aiming for *sustainable energy*. And as a leader, particularly in a remote setting, your job isn’t to *enforce* balance, but to *enable* that sustained energy for your team.

I recently spoke with an engineering manager who described the constant drain of trying to "fix" her team’s burnout with perks and empty promises of more vacation. She realized that wasn’t addressing the core issue: a lack of genuine engagement and meaningful work. This isn't about perks; it's about fundamentally understanding what drives people and creating an environment where they can thrive.

Let's be honest: the old advice – “take more vacation!” or “leave work at 5pm!” – often feels tone-deaf. A nice house further from work isn't worth the cost of a drained, unfulfilled team member. Many team members find that the benefits of a longer commute are outweighed by the impact on their well-being. This isn't about perks; it's about fundamentally understanding what drives people and creating an environment where they can thrive.

## The Four Factors: Ability, Interest, Effort, and a Bit of Luck

A while back, I stumbled across a simple but powerful framework that really resonated with me. As one framework suggests, great work, and by extension, a fulfilling work *life*, comes down to four factors: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Let's unpack how this applies to remote leadership and fostering sustainable energy:

* **Ability:** Are your team members equipped to succeed? This goes beyond technical skills. Do they have the right tools, access to information, and ongoing learning opportunities? In a remote setting, proactively address potential skill gaps. Think training budgets, mentorship programs, or even dedicated “learning Fridays.” 
    * *Example:* If a team member is struggling with a new cloud technology, providing access to online courses and pairing them with a more experienced engineer can quickly address the gap.
* **Interest:** This is where it gets compelling. People who are genuinely interested in their work are less likely to feel burdened, even when the workload is heavy. As leaders, we can't *make* someone interested, but we can create opportunities for them to connect their work to something they *do* care about.
    * **Actionable Tip:** Regularly have one-on-ones that go beyond project status. Ask about their career aspirations, what excites them, and how you can help align their work with those passions. Even small adjustments can make a huge difference.
* **Effort:** Effort isn’t about grinding; it’s about focused energy. When ability and interest are high, effort feels less like work and more like flow. However, even the most engaged team member needs boundaries.
* **Luck:** Let's be real - sometimes things fall into place, and sometimes they don't. As a leader, you can't control luck, but you *can* create an environment where your team is positioned to capitalize on opportunities when they arise. This means fostering a culture of experimentation, psychological safety, and open communication. 

## Remote Leadership & The Risk of "Checking Out"

When one or more of the four factors are consistently lacking, the result is often "checking out" – where team members become disengaged and simply go through the motions. A key anti-pattern is micromanaging or overly focusing on *hours worked*. It signals a lack of trust and actively *demotivates* people.

Instead, focus on *outcomes*.

* **Define Clear Goals:** Ensure everyone understands *what* needs to be achieved, *why* it’s important, and *how* their work contributes to the bigger picture.
* **Trust Your Team:** Give them the autonomy to manage their time and approach their work in a way that suits them.
* **Regular Check-Ins (Not Status Meetings):** Focus on roadblocks, learning opportunities, and how you can support their progress.
* **Celebrate Wins (Big and Small):** Recognition is a powerful motivator. Publicly acknowledge individual and team accomplishments.

## Beyond "Work-Life Balance" - Towards Sustainable Energy

"Work-life balance" feels like a destination. Sustainable energy feels like a way of *being*. It’s about building a team where people are genuinely engaged, challenged, and supported. It’s about understanding that a motivated, energized team isn't just *more productive*; it's a more fulfilling place to work – for everyone. 

As leaders, our job isn’t to dictate balance. It’s to cultivate the conditions where sustainable energy can thrive. And that’s a far more powerful and impactful goal.

So, this week, schedule one-on-ones focused on understanding your team's career aspirations. What's one small change you can make to foster sustainable energy within your team?
