# Setting Clear Expectations

Remote work has unlocked incredible flexibility and access to talent. But it’s also amplified a challenge every engineering leader faces: setting clear expectations. In a co-located office, you can often *feel* if someone is struggling or misaligned. Remotely? Those signals are muted, making proactively defined and consistently reinforced expectations absolutely critical. 

I recently worked with a team where a critical feature was delivered, but didn’t meet the intended business outcome. After digging in, we discovered the team had built *exactly* what was asked for, but the underlying assumptions about *why* it was needed weren’t clearly communicated. This disconnect led to wasted effort, rework, and a delayed launch. It highlighted, yet again, how crucial clear expectations are – especially when teams are distributed.

I've seen teams thrive and flounder based almost entirely on how effectively expectations were established. It's not about micromanagement; it’s about creating a shared understanding of *what* needs to be done, *why* it matters, and *how* success will be measured. Let's dive into practical strategies, drawing from both successes and hard-learned lessons over two decades leading engineering teams.

## The Cost of Ambiguity in a Remote World

Think about a recent project where things didn’t go as planned. Often, the root cause isn’t lack of skill, but a disconnect in understanding. “We thought you meant X,” or “I assumed Y was handled elsewhere” are common refrains. These ambiguities are costly – wasted effort, rework, frustration, and ultimately, delayed delivery. 

Remotely, this cost is *magnified*. Informal hallway conversations, quick check-ins, and reading body language – the “water cooler moments” that clarify intent – are largely gone. You *must* be intentional about over-communicating and documenting expectations.

## A Framework for Remote Expectation Setting

I've found a three-pronged approach works best: **Definition, Documentation, and Dialogue.**

**1. Definition: The "What" and the "Why"**

* **Outcome-Based Specifications:** Focus on *what* needs to be achieved, not *how* to achieve it. Instead of "Implement feature X using library Y," try "Deliver feature X, enabling user Z to accomplish goal A, resulting in metric B improving by C%." This fosters ownership and allows engineers to leverage their expertise.
* **Prioritization is Paramount:** Remote teams can easily get bogged down in context switching. Be crystal clear about priorities. Use a framework like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have) to guide decision-making. *MoSCoW prioritization helps categorize tasks based on their criticality to the overall outcome.* Transparency around *why* certain things are prioritized builds trust and understanding.
* **Define "Done":** This sounds basic, but it's often overlooked. What constitutes “done” for a task? Is it code committed, tested, documented, and deployed to staging? Spell it out. A clear “Definition of Done” prevents scope creep and ensures everyone is on the same page.

**2. Documentation: Making Expectations Tangible**

* **Centralized Knowledge Base:** Tools like Confluence, Notion, or even a well-organized Google Drive are essential. Document *everything* – project goals, technical specifications, coding standards, on-call procedures, and communication protocols.
* **Asynchronous Communication First:** Default to written communication whenever possible. This creates a record of decisions and ensures everyone has access to the same information, regardless of time zone.
* **Record Key Decisions:** After meetings, circulate a brief summary of decisions made and action items assigned. This eliminates ambiguity and ensures accountability. I’ve found a simple bullet-point list often works best – avoid long, narrative summaries.

**3. Dialogue: Ensuring Mutual Understanding**

* **Regular 1:1s:** These aren't just about task updates. Dedicate time to discussing expectations, challenges, and career goals. Ask open-ended questions like, "What's blocking you from delivering on this expectation?" or "How can I better support you in achieving this goal?"
* **Team Check-Ins:** Conduct regular team meetings focused on alignment and problem-solving. Create a safe space for team members to voice concerns and challenge assumptions.
* **Active Listening & Clarification:** Don't just *hear* your team members – *listen* to them. Ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand their perspective. Paraphrase their statements to confirm your understanding.

## Avoiding Common Pitfalls

* **Assuming Understanding:** Never assume your team members understand your expectations. Always ask them to reiterate what they understand.
* **Expecting Mind-Reading:** Don’t expect your team members to anticipate your needs. Be proactive in communicating your expectations.
* **Lack of Follow-Up:** Setting expectations is only half the battle. You must follow up regularly to ensure your team is on track.

## A Final Thought – Inspired by Hazlitt & Lehtinen

Henry Hazlitt's “Economics in One Lesson” emphasizes understanding the long-term consequences of actions. Similarly, setting clear expectations isn't just about the immediate task; it's about building a foundation of trust, accountability, and shared understanding.  As Lehtinen et al. highlight, a disconnect between expectations and outcomes is a common failure point. *Their research demonstrates that misalignment between perceived and actual expectations is a major driver of project failure,* reinforcing the need for proactive communication. Investing the time and effort to define, document, and dialogue around expectations will pay dividends in the long run – resulting in more satisfied teams, higher-quality work, and improved outcomes.

Remember, remote leadership isn't about replicating the office environment online. It's about intentionally creating a system that fosters clarity, trust, and accountability – and it all starts with setting expectations that actually land.
