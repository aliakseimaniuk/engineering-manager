# Effective Virtual Meetings

For two decades I've been building and leading engineering teams, and for the last decade, a *significant* portion of that leadership has happened…well, *through* a screen. And let me tell you, virtual meetings have a bad reputation. Often deservedly so. Engineering leaders are drowning in virtual meetings that steal valuable time and stifle productivity. But it doesn't have to be this way. We’ve all been in them – the ones that feel like a black hole for productivity, where action items get lost in the digital ether, and everyone silently multi-tasks.  Studies estimate that companies lose billions of dollars annually due to unproductive meetings.

But the problem isn't *meetings* themselves. The problem is *ineffective* meetings. And with tools like Showtime, Connect, Tadum, and even the seemingly endless project management platforms (Taiga, Tara AI, Teamwork, MeisterTask) vying for our attention, it's easy to fall into the trap of *more* tools, *more* meetings, and ultimately, *less* actual work. 

This post isn’t about advocating for *fewer* meetings (though that's often a good start). It’s about fundamentally rethinking how we approach them, turning them from time-wasters into focused, productive sessions. I call it “The Anti-Meeting.”

## The Core Principles of the Anti-Meeting

The Anti-Meeting isn't a specific tool or technique, but a mindset built on three core principles:

1. **Intentionality:** Every meeting needs a clear purpose, a defined outcome, and a targeted attendee list. If you can’t answer those three questions *before* scheduling, reconsider if a meeting is necessary at all.  Often, a quick Slack message, a shared document with comments, or a brief 1:1 will suffice.
2. **Focus & Structure:** Respect people’s time by keeping meetings concise and tightly focused. Agendas are *mandatory*. And not just a bullet point list of topics, but a *detailed* agenda with estimated time allocations for each item.  This isn't about rigidity; it's about creating a shared understanding of what needs to be covered and how long it will take.
3. **Action & Accountability:** Every meeting should result in clear, actionable next steps with assigned owners.  Those action items aren’t just written down; they are *immediately* captured in a shared system (project management tool, task list, whatever works for your team) and tracked to completion. 

## Putting it into Practice: A Simple Framework

I’ve found this framework consistently improves the effectiveness of virtual (and even in-person) meetings:

**1. Pre-Meeting: The "Prime the Pump" Phase**

* **Define the "Why":** What problem are we solving? What decision needs to be made?  Communicate this clearly in the meeting invite.
* **Detailed Agenda with Timeboxes:** Don’t just list topics; estimate how long each item will take.  Be realistic. A 30-minute meeting isn’t the time to debate a complex architectural decision. 
* **Pre-Read Materials:** Share any necessary documents, data, or proposals *before* the meeting. This allows attendees to come prepared and maximizes discussion time.  This is *critical* for asynchronous communication to function.
* **Attendee List Audit:** Be ruthless. Only invite people who *absolutely need* to be there.  Larger groups diminish participation and focus.  Consider sending a summary to those who need to be kept informed.

**2. During the Meeting: The “Stay on Track” Phase**

* **Start with the “Why”:** Briefly reiterate the purpose of the meeting to ensure everyone is aligned.
* **Stick to the Agenda:** Politely but firmly redirect conversations that stray off-topic.  If a tangential discussion is important, schedule a separate meeting to address it.
* **Facilitating Participation:** Actively solicit input from all attendees.  Use tools like polls or virtual hand-raising to encourage participation, especially in larger meetings.
* **Staying on Track:** Monitor the time and gently guide the conversation back to the agenda when necessary.
* **Timekeeping:** Keep a close eye on the clock and adjust the agenda as needed. If you’re running short on time, prioritize the most important topics.
* **Visual Aids:** Share your screen to present data, diagrams, or presentations. Visuals help to maintain focus and convey information more effectively.

**3. Post-Meeting: The "Drive Results" Phase**

* **Immediate Action Item Capture:** *Before* ending the meeting, ensure all action items are clearly defined, assigned to owners, and added to your tracking system. Don't rely on memory or email follow-ups. This can be done by documenting action items directly in a shared document during the meeting or by assigning owners in real-time within your project management tool.
* **Share a Summary (Optional):** For complex discussions or decisions, a brief summary of key takeaways and action items can be helpful.
* **Follow Up:** Regularly check on the progress of action items and provide support as needed. This demonstrates accountability and ensures that the meeting doesn’t become a superficial exercise.  Use a project management tool like Taiga or Teamwork to track these items and ensure follow-through.

## Beyond the Basics: 

The plethora of tools out there can be overwhelming. Honestly, the *tool itself is secondary* to the principles outlined above. However, it’s important to choose tools that align with your team’s workflow and make it easier to implement the principles of the Anti-Meeting. 

## Reclaiming Our Time 

Virtual meetings aren't going away.  But we *can* reclaim our time and focus by approaching them with intention, structure, and accountability.  By embracing the principles of the Anti-Meeting, we can transform these potential time-wasters into productive sessions that drive results.  It’s not about having *fewer* meetings, it’s about having *better* ones.  

Start implementing these principles in your next team meeting and reclaim valuable time and focus.
