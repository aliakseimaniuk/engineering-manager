# Mentorship Relationships

How often do you ask for help? As engineering managers, we’re often expected to *have* the answers, but what if the key to better leadership lies in admitting you don’t? For years, I focused almost exclusively on *being* a mentor. Guiding junior engineers, helping them navigate technical challenges, and fostering their career growth felt like a core part of my role as a leader. It *is* important. But recently, I’ve realized something profound: the most impactful leaders aren’t just those who give mentorship, they’re those who actively *receive* it. 

We, as engineering managers, often position ourselves as the 'experts,' the ones with the answers. This creates a subtle barrier to vulnerability, to admitting we don't have everything figured out. And that’s precisely why cultivating mentorship *relationships* - where the flow of knowledge isn’t always one-way - is critical for personal and professional development.

## The Trap of the "Expert"

It's easy to fall into the trap of believing we need to project an image of competence. We fear admitting uncertainty might erode trust with our teams. However, this is a false dichotomy. Authenticity and vulnerability *build* trust. When we show our teams we're committed to our own learning, it creates a psychological safety net where they feel comfortable admitting their own challenges. 

I’ve seen this play out firsthand. Early in my career, I was reluctant to ask for help, fearing it would be perceived as weakness. I spent countless hours struggling with problems I could have solved quickly with the guidance of a more experienced colleague. When I *finally* started seeking advice, not only did I learn faster, but I also forged stronger relationships with those I sought help from. 

## Why *Receiving* Mentorship is Crucial for Engineering Managers

Here’s how actively participating in mentorship – as a mentee – benefits engineering managers specifically:

* **Expanded Perspective:**  We often get deeply embedded in our own team's challenges and the specific technical stack we’re working with. A mentor from a different domain, company, or even a different *role* (like product management or design) can offer a fresh perspective on problems we've been wrestling with. For example, a mentor from the product team helped me realize we were overcomplicating a feature because we hadn’t fully considered the user's core needs.
* **Blind Spot Identification:**  Let's face it, we all have them. A good mentor will gently challenge our assumptions and point out areas where we might be overlooking critical issues. This isn't about being told we're wrong; it's about gaining clarity and making more informed decisions.
* **Emotional Support & Navigation:** Leadership can be isolating. Having someone to confide in, someone who understands the pressures and complexities of our role, is invaluable. A mentor can provide a sounding board, offer encouragement, and help us navigate difficult conversations or situations. Recognizing the weight of responsibility and having a safe space to discuss it is crucial for preventing burnout.
* **Skill Development Beyond Technical Expertise:** While we’re often strong on the technical side, areas like conflict resolution, delegation, and strategic thinking require ongoing development. A mentor can provide guidance and feedback in these areas. 
* **Modeling Lifelong Learning:** As leaders, we set the tone for our teams. By actively seeking mentorship, we demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning and growth, inspiring our engineers to do the same. Studies have shown that teams with leaders who prioritize learning are more innovative and engaged. [Consider linking to a relevant HBR article here if desired]

It’s important to acknowledge that finding time for mentorship can be difficult. We’re all busy. But prioritizing our own development isn't selfish; it's an investment in our ability to lead effectively.

## Finding *Your* Mentor – It's Not Always What You Expect

So how do you actually *find* a mentor? The good news is it doesn't have to look like a traditional, formal arrangement. The idea of "mentorship" can conjure images of formal, long-term relationships, but mentorship doesn’t *always* need to be a formal, long-term arrangement. Effective mentorship can take many forms:

* **Peer Mentorship:** Connect with other engineering managers facing similar challenges. Share experiences, offer advice, and learn from each other.
* **Reverse Mentorship:** Seek guidance from junior engineers on topics like emerging technologies or different perspectives on team dynamics. (I've learned *a lot* from this approach!)
* **"Situational" Mentorship:** Reach out to individuals with specific expertise for advice on a particular problem. This can be a one-time conversation or an ongoing exchange.
* **External Mentorship:** Connect with leaders outside your company for broader perspectives and industry insights.

I recently started participating in a book club with fellow engineering leaders. It’s a surprisingly effective form of mentorship. We discuss leadership challenges, share insights from books, and offer each other support. It’s a low-pressure environment for learning and growth.

## The Importance of Reciprocity & Continuous Growth

Receiving and giving mentorship aren’t separate activities; they’re two sides of the same coin. By actively seeking guidance from others, we also become better mentors ourselves. Being open to feedback and sharing our own experiences builds stronger relationships and fosters a culture of continuous growth within our teams. Mentoring junior engineers, providing feedback to peers, and simply being a sounding board for colleagues will strengthen your network and enhance your own leadership skills.

Ultimately, becoming a more effective engineering manager isn’t just about mastering technical skills and leadership frameworks. It's about embracing a mindset of continuous learning, vulnerability, and collaboration. This week, identify one person you can ask for advice on a challenging situation. You might be surprised at the insights you gain.
