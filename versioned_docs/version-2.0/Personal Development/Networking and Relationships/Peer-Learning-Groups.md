# Peer Learning Groups

For twenty years, I’ve seen engineering leaders grapple with similar challenges: the ever-increasing complexity of technology, the pressure to deliver, and the constant need to grow – both as engineers *and* as leaders. We often focus on formal training, certifications, and conferences – which are valuable – but I’ve consistently found one of the most impactful development tools is surprisingly powerful: **peer learning groups.**

It’s not a new concept – humans have learned from each other for millennia. But as engineering managers, we often *facilitate* learning for our teams and neglect our *own* continuous development in a structured way. This article dives into why peer learning groups are so effective, how to build one, and how to ensure it thrives.

## Why Peer Learning Groups Work (and Why They’re Different)

Think about the typical learning scenarios for an engineering manager. You might attend a leadership workshop, read a book on Agile, or receive coaching. These are all *transmission* models – information flows *to* you. Peer learning flips this. It’s about *constructing* knowledge *with* others. 

Here's why that matters:

* **Contextual Relevance:** Challenges faced by other engineering managers are likely to resonate with your own, making discussions immediately applicable.
* **Psychological Safety:** A trusted group provides a safe space to admit vulnerabilities, ask “difficult” questions, and experiment with new ideas without fear of judgment. This is *critical* for growth.
* **Diverse Perspectives:** Each member brings a unique background, experience, and perspective. Diverse perspectives spark creative problem-solving and a wider understanding of complex issues.
* **Accountability & Motivation:** Knowing you’ll be discussing your progress (or lack thereof!) with your peers provides powerful motivation to take action.
* **It’s Sustainable:** Unlike a one-off workshop, a peer learning group is a continuous process that can adapt to evolving needs.

I’ve seen this play out repeatedly. A few years ago, I was part of a group that helped me navigate a tricky team restructuring. Hearing how others had handled similar situations – the missteps they’d made, the things they’d learned – was invaluable. It saved me weeks of agonizing and ultimately led to a much smoother outcome.

## Building Your Tribe: A Practical Guide

Okay, you’re convinced. Now how do you actually *build* a peer learning group? Here’s a framework I’ve found effective:

1. **Identify Your Focus:** What areas do you want to develop? Possible themes include: Leading Remote Teams, Scaling Engineering Organizations, Conflict Resolution, Technical Leadership, or even a specific technology. Being focused makes discussions more productive.
2. **Recruit the Right Members:** Aim for 4-6 people. Look for individuals who are:
    * **At a similar level of experience:** This fosters more meaningful discussions.
    * **Open-minded and willing to share:** Participation is key!
    * **Committed to regular meetings:** Consistency is vital.
3. **Establish Ground Rules:** This is crucial for psychological safety. Agree on:
    * **Confidentiality:** What is shared in the group stays in the group.
    * **Active Listening:** Truly hear and understand each other's perspectives.
    * **Constructive Feedback:** Focus on behavior, not personality.
    * **Respectful Dialogue:** Even when disagreeing.
4. **Define a Meeting Structure:** I recommend a structured format, like:
    * **Check-in (5-10 minutes):** A quick round-robin to share what’s top-of-mind.
    * **Topic Discussion (30-45 minutes):** Focused on a pre-defined topic. Consider using a shared document for notes.
    * **Challenge/Success Share (15-20 minutes):** Members share a current challenge or recent success. This is where the real peer support happens.
    * **Action Items/Wrap-up (5 minutes):** Identify next steps and schedule the next meeting.

5. **Leverage Free Resources**: Consider the following platforms to facilitate discussion. Teamwork.com offers integrated project management and chat features ideal for tracking action items and facilitating asynchronous discussions. Alternatively, GitHub can be useful for document storage and collaboration. There are a number of free tiers for small groups.



## Keeping the Momentum Going

A peer learning group isn't a “set it and forget it” endeavor. Instead of simply maintaining the group, anticipate potential challenges. One common issue is maintaining consistent participation. Here's how to address it: proactively rotate facilitation responsibilities to keep everyone engaged. Another challenge is ensuring the group remains relevant. Regularly review the focus and adjust topics to align with evolving needs.  

Here are a few additional tips:

* **Rotate Facilitation:** Share the responsibility of leading meetings.
* **Regularly Review the Focus:** Ensure the group is still addressing relevant topics.
* **Encourage Accountability:** Gently nudge each other to follow through on action items.
* **Celebrate Successes:** Acknowledge and appreciate each other's progress.
* **Be Patient:** It takes time to build trust and create a truly effective group.

I've noticed a pattern in the best engineering managers: they are lifelong learners. They actively seek out opportunities to grow, and they understand the power of collaboration. Building a peer learning group is a powerful way to invest in your own development, and to help others do the same. It’s not about having all the answers; it’s about collaborative learning.
