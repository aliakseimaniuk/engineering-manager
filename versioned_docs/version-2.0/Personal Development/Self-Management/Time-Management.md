# Time Management

Time. It's the one resource we all have the same amount of, yet some engineering managers seem to bend it to their will while others are constantly drowning. As we move up the ladder from individual contributor to manager, the expectation isn’t just to *manage* our own time, but the time of our team, and navigate a relentless stream of meetings, one-on-ones, incident responses, and strategic planning. It's a paradox: the more responsibility we take on, the less *time* we seem to have.

This isn't a post about productivity hacks or the latest time-blocking app (though I’ll touch on tools). It's about fundamentally *shifting* how you relate to time as an engineering manager – moving from feeling reactive and overwhelmed to proactively shaping your day and maximizing impact.

## The Myth of "Getting Things Done"

We're bombarded with advice about "getting things done." But as managers, simply completing tasks isn't the goal. It’s enabling *others* to do their best work. This requires a different approach to time. I've seen too many talented engineers, and their managers, fall into the trap of individual contribution creeping back into their days. "Just quickly fixing this bug…" or "I can just write that documentation myself…" These actions steal time from higher-leverage activities – things *only* a manager can do.

The first step is brutal honesty: **what are you doing that someone else *could* be doing?** This isn't about delegation (though that’s important), it's about identifying tasks that are below your pay grade, or better suited to someone else’s skills.  

**Actionable Step:** For the next week, keep a detailed time log. Not just what you *did*, but *why* you did it. You'll likely be surprised by how much time is spent on tasks that don't align with your core managerial responsibilities.

## Prioritization Beyond Urgent vs. Important

The Eisenhower Matrix (urgent/important) is a solid starting point for prioritization, but it often falls short for engineering management. While it helps distinguish between immediate fires and long-term goals, it doesn't adequately address the *type* of work that truly moves the needle. We need a layer that considers **impact and leverage**.

Many engineering managers find that simply being “important” isn’t enough. We need to focus on work that unlocks the potential of the entire team. That’s why I’ve adapted a framework I call the **RICE-L Matrix:**

* **Reach:** How many people/teams will this impact?
* **Impact:** What’s the magnitude of that impact? (low/medium/high)
* **Confidence:** How confident are you in this outcome? (low/medium/high)
* **Effort:** How much effort is required? (low/medium/high)
* **Leverage:** This is the key addition. **How much of this work enables others to be more productive?** (low/medium/high)

Prioritize tasks with high Leverage, even if Reach or Impact are moderate. Investing in team processes, unblocking engineers, or clarifying requirements will yield a far greater return than single-handedly tackling a complex feature.

## The Power of Asynchronous Communication

Meetings are the time-eaters of engineering management. While some are unavoidable, many can be significantly reduced with a shift towards asynchronous communication.

* **Document Decisions:** Instead of lengthy meetings to debate options, create a shared document outlining the problem, proposed solutions, and rationale for the chosen approach. Let people review and provide feedback asynchronously.
* **Embrace Written Updates:** Short, concise written updates (using tools like Slack threads or dedicated project communication platforms) can often replace status meetings.
* **“Office Hours”:** Instead of scheduling individual meetings for quick questions, establish dedicated "office hours" where engineers can drop in (virtually or in person) with their questions.

This requires discipline and a culture of clear documentation, but the time savings are substantial.

## Time Tracking - Not to Police, But to Understand

I'm not a huge fan of micromanaging time tracking, but *understanding* how time is being spent is crucial. Tools like Clockify, Toggl Track, or even integrations within platforms like ZenHub can provide valuable insights.

The goal isn’t to measure productivity, but to identify time leaks and patterns. Are engineers consistently spending too much time in meetings? Are there recurring roadblocks that need to be addressed?  Use this data to inform your process improvements and resource allocation.

## The Most Important Time Investment: Yourself

Finally, remember that you can’t effectively manage others’ time if you’re running on empty. Schedule dedicated time for:

* **Deep Work:** Block out uninterrupted time for strategic thinking, planning, and tackling complex problems.
* **Learning & Development:** Stay current with technology and leadership skills.
* **Recharge:**  Prioritize your physical and mental well-being.

**Actionable Step:** Schedule 30-60 minutes of dedicated “Deep Work” into your calendar for next week, and treat it as a non-negotiable appointment.

**In Conclusion:**

Time management isn't about squeezing more tasks into your day. It's about making conscious choices about how you spend your most valuable resource – enabling your team to thrive. By shifting your mindset, embracing asynchronous communication, and prioritizing your own well-being, you can unlock a new level of effectiveness as an engineering manager and regain control of your day. This isn't just about getting things done; it's about building a more productive, engaged, and sustainable team – and ultimately, achieving greater job satisfaction for everyone involved.
