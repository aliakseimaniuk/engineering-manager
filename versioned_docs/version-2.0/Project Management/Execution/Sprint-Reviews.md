# Sprint Reviews

For 20+ years I’ve been building and leading engineering teams, and I’ve seen a *lot* of Sprint Reviews. Sadly, far too many feel…performative. A demo of completed work, a quick round of “good job!”, and then everyone scatters. While *showing* progress is important, a truly valuable Sprint Review is about so much more. It’s a critical inspection and adaptation opportunity – a cornerstone of the Agile framework – and when done right, it can dramatically improve your product, your team, and your stakeholder relationships.

This isn't about adhering to a rigid ceremony. It’s about maximizing the value *from* the ceremony. Let's dig into how to move beyond the demo and transform your Sprint Reviews into a powerful engine for learning and growth.

## The Problem with "Just" a Demo

Let's be honest: showcasing finished work is the easy part. It *feels* productive, but it often misses the deeper purpose. We fall into the trap of focusing on *what* was delivered, instead of *why* it was delivered, and more importantly, *how* it impacts the bigger picture. I've seen teams meticulously prepare demos, only to reveal features that nobody actually needed, or that didn't solve the right problem. This isn't the team's fault, it’s a symptom of a broken review process.

The core issue? A passive audience. Stakeholders, product owners, and even other engineers become spectators instead of active participants. The energy flows in one direction, and valuable feedback – and learning opportunities – are lost.

## Reimagining the Sprint Review: A Focus on Collaboration

Here’s how to shift from a demo-centric approach to a collaborative inspection and adaptation session.

**1. Set the Stage: Purpose & Agenda**

* **Clearly define the purpose:** Remind everyone that the review isn’t just a status update. It's an opportunity to inspect the increment, adapt the product backlog, and collaborate on next steps.
* **Pre-share the increment:** Don't surprise anyone with new functionality. Give stakeholders access to the working software *before* the review, so they can explore it at their own pace and formulate thoughtful questions. A staging environment or shared link is crucial.
* **Focused Agenda:** A simple agenda works best:
  * **Review Goals:** Reiterate the sprint goal.
  * **What was delivered:** (Briefly!) Highlight key features.
  * **Demo/Discussion:** The bulk of the time should be spent *discussing* the value delivered, not just *showing* it.
  * **Feedback & Next Steps:** Open the floor for feedback, and collaboratively refine the backlog based on what was learned.

**2. The Demo: Value-Driven, Not Feature-Driven**

* **Focus on the "Why":** Don't just show *how* a feature works. Explain *why* it was built, what problem it solves, and how it benefits the user.
* **User Stories as a Guide:** Frame the demo around the user stories completed during the sprint. This keeps the focus on value delivery.
* **Keep it Concise:** No one wants a 30-minute deep dive into every minor detail. Focus on the most important aspects of the increment.

**3. Facilitating Meaningful Discussion**

This is where the magic happens. Here are some questions to spark conversation:

* **“What surprised you about what we delivered?”** – Encourages stakeholders to think critically and share unexpected insights.
* **“How does this increment help us move closer to our overall product vision?”** – Connects the sprint work to the bigger picture.
* **“What are your biggest concerns or questions about this increment?”** – Creates a safe space for honest feedback.
* **“Based on what you’ve seen, what should we prioritize in the next sprint?”** – Collaboratively refines the backlog.

Here's an example of how this can play out:

**Stakeholder:** "I'm concerned this new feature feels clunky on mobile."
**Team Response:** "Okay, let's add a user story to address mobile responsiveness in the next sprint."

**4. Beyond the Meeting: Actionable Outcomes**

The Sprint Review shouldn’t be the *end* of the conversation. Document key takeaways, action items, and backlog updates. Share this information with the team and stakeholders to ensure everyone is aligned.

## Addressing Common Pitfalls

* **Actively encourage participation from all stakeholders:** Ensure everyone has a voice. Actively solicit feedback from quieter participants.
* **Keep the conversation focused on value and impact:** Getting lost in technical details can derail the discussion. Defer detailed technical discussions to separate forums. (You don’t need to explain implementation details to your marketing team!)
* **Treat negative feedback as valuable information:** Don't dismiss concerns. Use it to improve.

## From Demo-Centric to Collaborative: A Quick Look

| **Traditional Sprint Review** | **Collaborative Sprint Review** |
|---|---|
| Team *presents* completed features | Team and stakeholders *discuss* the value delivered |
| Stakeholders are passive observers | Stakeholders actively participate and provide feedback |
| Focus on *what* was built | Focus on *why* it was built and *how* it impacts users |
| Limited opportunity for adaptation | Continuous inspection and adaptation of the product backlog |

## Tools to Support Collaboration

While tools aren’t the *solution*, they can facilitate better collaboration. Consider these:

* **Shared Document/Board (Jira, Trello, Miro):** These platforms allow for real-time collaboration, capturing feedback, action items, and backlog updates in a central location. Jira, for example, allows for direct linking of user stories to review feedback, creating a traceable connection between value delivery and stakeholder input.
* **Screen Sharing:** Essential for demos.
* **Retrospective Tools (easyretro.io):** While geared toward retrospectives, they can also be used to capture feedback during the review.

## Final Thoughts

The Sprint Review isn't just another meeting on the calendar. It's a critical opportunity to inspect, adapt, and collaborate. By shifting the focus from *showing* to *discussing*, you can unlock the true potential of this powerful Agile ceremony and drive significant improvements in your product, your team, and your stakeholder relationships.

As Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson point out in “Rework”, prioritizing simplicity and focus is key. Don’t overcomplicate the process. The goal is to deliver value and learn, not to create a bureaucratic ritual.

**Challenge:** This week, focus on actively soliciting feedback from quieter participants during your Sprint Review and see how it changes the conversation.
