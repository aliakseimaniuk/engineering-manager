# Vendor Management

Vendor management. The phrase itself can conjure images of endless contracts, tedious RFPs, and a general administrative headache. As engineering leaders, we often *get assigned* vendor management, viewing it as a necessary evil, a “check the box” activity. But what if I told you that effective vendor management isn't about *managing* vendors, but about building *relationships* that directly impact your team’s velocity, innovation, and ultimately, success?

Consider this: studies show that project delays and cost overruns are frequently tied to poor vendor collaboration and communication. It's easy to get caught up in process, but losing sight of the *people* on the other end can be costly. I’ve seen this firsthand throughout my career, from my time at a large supply chain financing company with over 5 million suppliers – demonstrating the sheer scale of external dependencies many organizations face – to more recent experiences integrating third-party code using tools like FOSSA. The difference between a successful project and a frustrating one often boils down to how well we’ve fostered those relationships. I even saw this recently where non-technical management prioritized process over engagement, quickly overshadowing critical issues.

This article will move beyond the typical ‘how-to’ of vendor management, and focus on the principles and practices that turn vendors into true partners.

## The Shift: From Transactional to Relational

Traditional vendor management focuses on cost reduction and risk mitigation. These are important, of course, but they represent a *transactional* approach. A relational approach, on the other hand, prioritizes building mutual trust and understanding. Think of it like this:

* **Transactional:** "We need this service for the lowest possible price, and we'll hold you strictly to the contract."
* **Relational:** "We see you as a key partner in achieving our goals, and we’re invested in your success as well."

This shift requires a change in mindset and a few key practices:

1. **Go Beyond the RFP:** RFPs are essential, but they tell only part of the story. Schedule calls with potential vendors to truly understand their capabilities, their culture, and their long-term vision. Don't just ask about features; ask about their roadmap. Are they investing in areas that align with your future needs?
2. **Invest in Communication:** Regular, open communication is crucial. Establish a cadence for check-ins, not just when there's a problem. Share your team’s goals, challenges, and feedback. Consider a shared communication channel (Slack, Teams, etc.) for quick questions and updates.
3. **Treat Vendors as Internal Stakeholders:** Include key vendor representatives in relevant meetings and discussions. Give them visibility into your product roadmap and engineering plans. The more they understand your business, the better they can support you.
4. **Provide Constructive Feedback:** Don't wait for annual reviews to provide feedback. Offer specific, actionable feedback on their performance, both positive and negative. This shows you're invested in their improvement.
5. **Understand Their Business:** What are *their* challenges? What pressures are *they* facing? Understanding their perspective will help you build a more collaborative and mutually beneficial relationship.

## Managing the Technical Side: Open Source and Third-Party Code

The rise of open-source software and third-party components has dramatically increased our reliance on external dependencies. This makes robust vendor (or, in this case, *community*) management even more critical. Tools like FOSSA can help manage license compliance and vulnerabilities, but they're only part of the equation.

Here’s where a relational approach shines:

* **Active Participation:** Don't just *consume* open-source libraries; contribute back to the community. Submit bug fixes, contribute code, and participate in discussions. This builds goodwill and ensures the long-term health of the projects you rely on.
* **Security is a Shared Responsibility:** Work closely with vendors to understand their security practices and ensure they align with your standards. Don’t treat security reviews as adversarial; view them as a collaborative effort to identify and mitigate risks.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep a detailed inventory of all your external dependencies and proactively monitor for vulnerabilities. Automated tools can help, but human oversight is essential.

## Tooling for Success (Without Becoming Reliant)

While relationships are paramount, the right tools can streamline the vendor management process. However, it's crucial to remember that these tools *facilitate* relational practices, they don’t *replace* them.

* **Project Management Platforms:** Tools like Contriber.com, Crosswork, or Codegiant can help you track vendor deliverables, manage contracts, and monitor performance, fostering transparency and accountability.
* **Communication Platforms:** Slack, Teams, or dedicated vendor portals facilitate ongoing communication and collaboration.
* **Dependency Management Tools:** FOSSA, and similar tools, automate license compliance and vulnerability scanning, allowing you to focus on building stronger relationships.
* **Customer Support Systems:** For vendor-provided services, tools like Desk can help manage support tickets and ensure timely resolution.

**Important Note:** Don’t become overly reliant on any single tool. I’ve seen projects derail when entire processes are built around a single platform, leaving little room for flexibility when things inevitably change.

## From Pain Point to Partnership

Vendor management doesn't have to be a dreaded task. By shifting your mindset from transactional to relational, and by prioritizing communication, collaboration, and mutual respect, you can transform vendors into true partners that fuel your engineering success.

**Let's take this a step further:** Schedule a 30-minute call with your top three vendors this week to discuss their challenges and priorities. This small investment can yield significant returns in terms of improved collaboration, increased innovation, and stronger partnerships.

By embracing this approach, you’ll not only improve your team’s velocity and quality but also build lasting relationships that contribute to long-term success. Remember, strong vendor relationships are an investment, not an expense.
