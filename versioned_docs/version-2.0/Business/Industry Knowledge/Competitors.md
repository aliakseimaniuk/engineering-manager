# Competitors

For two decades, I've seen engineering teams pour their hearts into building products, only to be blindsided not by the company they *thought* was the enemy, but by something completely unexpected. I recall one company, a leader in enterprise software, utterly shocked when a social media platform began chipping away at their market share by offering a surprisingly effective (and free) collaboration tool. We obsess over feature parity with competitors, benchmarking against established players, and meticulously tracking their moves. While understanding direct competition is vital, fixating solely on it can be a fatal flaw. The true threats – and the biggest opportunities – often lie *outside* the obvious competitive landscape.

This isn’t about ignoring rivals. It’s about broadening your perspective and recognizing that disruption rarely comes from head-to-head battles. It comes from unexpected corners – from companies addressing a problem in a fundamentally different way, or even from entirely *new* problems that steal your potential users' attention.

## The Dinosaur and the Asteroid: Why Innovation Stalls the Champions

As the provided context hints, established players often falter not because of competition, but because of *lack* of innovation. They become focused on defending market share, optimizing existing products, and pleasing investors – a natural consequence of success. This creates a fertile ground for newcomers to leapfrog them with fresh approaches.

Think of the early days of wearable fitness trackers. The UP series, initially successful, ultimately lost ground to Fitbit (2010s) and others. Not necessarily because of direct feature competition, but because Fitbit simplified the user experience and focused relentlessly on ease of use – a different value proposition.

This is why constantly asking "What's *not* being done?" is more valuable than "What are they doing?". Encourage your team to spend time exploring tangential problems, adjacent markets, and completely different solutions. A competitor is trying to *beat* you at the same game. A true disrupter is playing a different game altogether.

## From Analysis to Action: Building a Resilient Engineering Vision

It's easy to get caught up in the daily grind of feature development and competitive analysis, but truly resilient engineering leadership requires stepping back and proactively scanning the horizon. Before we dive into identifying these potential disruptors, let’s look at how to translate awareness into action.

* **Dedicated "Horizon Scanning":** Allocate a small percentage of engineering time to explore emerging technologies, adjacent markets, and competitive landscapes. This isn't about building features today; it's about building a vision for the future.
* **Regular Competitive (and Non-Competitive) Reviews:** Beyond analyzing direct competitors, dissect the strategies of the players identified below. What are their strengths and weaknesses? What can you learn from them?
* **Embrace Controlled Experimentation:** Don't be afraid to experiment with new technologies or business models, even if they seem unrelated to your core product. This allows you to stay agile and adapt to changing market conditions.
* **Cultivate a Culture of Curiosity:** Encourage your team to question assumptions, explore new ideas, and challenge the status quo. Innovation thrives in environments where curiosity is valued.

## Beyond Feature Wars: Identifying Key Players & Their Motivations

So, how do you identify these "key players" – those who pose the real threat, even if they aren’t direct competitors? Here’s a framework I’ve found useful:

* **The Adjacent Innovator:** These companies aren’t solving the same problem *exactly*, but they're tackling a related one with a novel approach. They often steal attention and resources that could have gone to your product. (Example: Slack initially wasn't a direct competitor to email, but it fundamentally changed how teams communicate, chipping away at email’s dominance).
* **The Ecosystem Builder:** These players aren't focused on a single product, but on creating a platform or ecosystem that attracts users and developers. (Example: Apple. They don’t just sell phones, they sell an entire experience.)
* **The "Low-End" Disruptor:** These companies initially target a niche market with a simpler, cheaper solution. They gradually improve and expand, eventually challenging the incumbents. (Example: Early Linux distributions challenging established operating systems – and ultimately becoming a major player in the market).
* **The Funding Magnet:** Pay attention to startups receiving significant investment, even if their current product seems irrelevant. Funding provides the oxygen for experimentation and the ability to pivot quickly.

Crucially, understanding *their motivations* is key. As highlighted in *Venture Deals* by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson, venture capitalist interests aren’t always aligned with your own. What are their long-term goals? Who are *they* trying to displace? Knowing this will help you anticipate their moves and adjust your strategy.

## Actionable Steps: Building a Resilient Engineering Vision

Taking the time to understand these players is only valuable if it translates into action. We’ve already covered how to integrate horizon scanning into your team’s workflow, but it’s important to remember that strategic thinking requires dedicated effort. It’s easy to get bogged down in the day-to-day, but proactively challenging assumptions and exploring new possibilities is essential for long-term success.

The market doesn't reward legacy; it rewards innovation, adaptability, and a relentless focus on solving user problems. Don't fall victim to the "dinosaur" trap. By broadening your perspective, understanding the true key players, and proactively shaping your engineering vision, you can build a resilient and future-proof product that thrives in a constantly evolving world.

By actively scanning the periphery and understanding the motivations of all key players, you can build a resilient engineering vision that anticipates—and thrives in—a changing market.

What unexpected competitors are you watching, and what are you doing to prepare for the future?
