# Industry Trends

For two decades, I've led engineering teams through waves of “disruptive” technology. Each new framework, language, or platform arrives with promises of revolutionizing how we build things. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the constant influx of new technologies, and the pressure to adopt the latest and greatest is immense. As engineering leaders, our job isn't to chase *every* shiny object, but to discern which trends represent fundamental shifts with lasting impact – and, crucially, understand the business implications.

This isn't about predicting the future; it’s about building a team and strategy resilient enough to navigate it. Here's what I'm focusing on, and why you should be too – beyond the buzzwords.

## The Shift From Innovation to *Defensibility*

We’re entering an era where incremental innovation isn't enough. For years, “move fast and break things” worked. Now, the landscape is littered with the remains of companies that did just that – quickly, but without building lasting value. The story of many cleantech startups in the early 2000s illustrates this perfectly. While numerous companies developed marginally improved solar panels or biofuels, few achieved true market dominance. Without fundamental breakthroughs in energy storage or conversion efficiency, they struggled to compete with established players and ultimately failed. The game is changing. We need to move beyond just *creating solutions* to building things that are *defensible*.

This means prioritizing innovations that are difficult to replicate. It’s not enough to have a slightly better widget. You need a genuine *breakthrough* – something based on fundamentally new technology or a radically different approach. Think materials science, advanced manufacturing, or a truly novel algorithm.

**For engineering leaders, this means:**

* **Prioritize R&D with patent potential:** Don’t shy away from longer-term, riskier projects if they hold the promise of proprietary technology.
* **Challenge “fast follower” strategies:** Being second to market *can* work, but only if you have a clear path to differentiation based on defensible intellectual property.
* **Foster a culture of deep technical exploration:** Encourage your engineers to go beyond surface-level understanding and truly master the underlying principles of their field.

## Beyond Software: The Resurgence of Physical Innovation

For a long time, software ate the world. Now, we're seeing a resurgence of innovation in the physical realm – driven by advances in areas like:

* **Advanced Materials:**  Graphene, for example, is enabling lighter, stronger, and more conductive materials for a wide range of applications, from aerospace to consumer electronics.
* **Robotics & Automation:**  Companies like Boston Dynamics are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with robotics, enabling increasingly sophisticated automation in manufacturing, logistics, and even service industries.
* **Sustainable Technologies:**  The demand for clean energy, resource efficiency, and circular economies is driving innovation in areas like solid-state battery technology, carbon capture systems, and biodegradable plastics.

**Why this matters for engineering leadership:**

* **Cross-disciplinary teams are essential:** This isn't just a software problem anymore. You'll need to build teams that combine expertise in software, hardware, materials science, and other relevant fields.
* **Embrace prototyping and experimentation:**  Physical products require a different development process than software. You'll need to invest in prototyping, testing, and iterative refinement.
* **Consider the entire lifecycle:**  Durability and long-term sustainability are becoming increasingly important. Designing for repairability, recyclability, and resource efficiency is no longer optional.  

## The Expanding Definition of "Infrastructure"

We used to think of infrastructure as roads, bridges, and power grids. Now, the definition is expanding to include things like:

* **Data Infrastructure:**  The systems and processes for collecting, storing, and analyzing vast amounts of data – think cloud computing platforms and data lakes.
* **Cybersecurity Infrastructure:**  The measures taken to protect digital assets from cyber threats – including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption technologies.
* **Supply Chain Infrastructure:**  The network of suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors that deliver goods and services – a network increasingly reliant on real-time tracking and optimization.

**What does this mean for engineering leaders?**

* **Security must be baked in, not bolted on:**  Cybersecurity is no longer an afterthought. It needs to be integrated into every stage of the development process.
* **Resilience is key:**  Supply chain disruptions during the pandemic highlighted the importance of building resilient systems that can withstand unexpected shocks. Diversifying suppliers and building redundancy are critical.
* **Data governance is critical:**  As data becomes more valuable, it's essential to have clear policies and procedures for managing it responsibly and ethically.

## Tech as a Profession: The Long View

The article excerpt touches on a fascinating point: Is tech evolving into a true profession, like law or medicine? If so, what are the implications for our field? There are certainly forces pushing *against* this trend – the rapid pace of innovation and the emphasis on agility often discourage standardized practices. However, we are seeing a growing recognition that certain types of innovation require a different approach – one that emphasizes quality, reliability, and longevity.  

It’s not about stifling innovation. It’s about recognizing that building things that *last* requires a commitment to rigorous training, standardized practices, and a focus on long-term sustainability. We need to move beyond simply building things to building things that *endure*.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Focus on Defensibility:** Prioritize R&D with patent potential and challenge “fast follower” strategies.
* **Embrace Physical Innovation:**  Build cross-disciplinary teams and invest in prototyping.
* **Strengthen Infrastructure:**  Integrate security into every stage of development and prioritize resilience.
* **Professionalize Our Approach:** Recognize the value of rigorous training, standardized practices, and a focus on long-term sustainability.

Ultimately, as engineering leaders, our job isn’t just to keep up with the latest trends. It's to understand the underlying forces that are shaping the future and to build teams and strategies that are resilient enough to navigate it.

**Consider this:** What if your team spent the next quarter brainstorming technologies where you could build a genuine, defensible advantage? How would you shift your focus from simply "building" to building something that truly endures?  

Focus on building *defensible* technology, embracing physical innovation, strengthening infrastructure, and recognizing the evolving nature of our profession. That's how we'll ensure that our teams – and our companies – thrive in the years to come.
