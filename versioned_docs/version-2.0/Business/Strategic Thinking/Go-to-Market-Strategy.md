# Go To Market Strategy

For many engineering managers, "Go-to-Market" (GTM) feels like a marketing term, something *they* hand off to another team after months of building. That’s a mistake. As leaders responsible for execution, we need to understand – and actively shape – the GTM strategy *before* the first line of code is written. A well-defined GTM isn’t just about launching a product; it’s about building a sustainable path to value for your customers *and* a defensible position in the market.

Consider this: studies show that over 90% of startups fail. While many factors contribute, a poorly defined GTM strategy is consistently near the top of the list. A product can be brilliantly engineered, but without a clear understanding of *who* will use it and *why*, it risks becoming another statistic.

I’ve seen countless projects stumble – even *good* ones – because the GTM was an afterthought. It's not enough to build it and hope they come. This isn't about dismissing the "fake it till you make it" mantra, but reframing it as rapid prototyping and learning – quickly testing assumptions and iterating based on real-world feedback, rather than bluffing your way to success.

## The Core Problem: Building vs. Selling

The default mindset in many engineering organizations is focused on *building* the best possible product. This is natural, and laudable. But a fantastic product, brilliantly executed, is useless if nobody *needs* it, or if the market is already saturated. We often fall into the trap of feature-building without deeply understanding *who* we're building for and *why* they'd choose us over the competition.

The key shift is to view the GTM as a hypothesis – a testable assumption about how you’ll reach, acquire, and retain customers. And just like any good engineering experiment, it requires clear metrics, a rapid iteration cycle, and a willingness to pivot when data dictates.  It's natural for engineering teams to prioritize building the best technical solution, but a truly successful product requires a parallel focus on understanding the market and the customer.

## Framework: The Three Pillars of a Defensible GTM

I’ve found it helpful to frame a GTM around three core pillars. Think of these as constraints that shape your product roadmap and ensure you’re building something that can thrive.

* **Niche Domination (Small Market Share in a Small Market):** This is where many successful startups begin. It's about finding a very specific customer segment with an underserved need. The beauty here is that you don't need to be the best at *everything*; you just need to be the best for *them*. This allows for focused development, quicker iteration, and a chance to build a loyal user base. Think of a specialized tool for 3D sculpting miniatures—a narrow market, but one where dedicated tools can command significant value.
    * **Engineering Implication:** This influences feature prioritization. Focus on solving the core problem for that niche, even if it means sacrificing broader functionality initially. Avoid “shiny object syndrome” and resist the urge to build features that appeal to a wider audience but don’t solve the core problem for your target niche.  For example, the team at Figma initially focused solely on collaborative UI design for web, foregoing features common in broader design suites like print layout or illustration.
* **Durability (Defensibility 10-20 Years Out):** What will prevent competitors from copying your solution? This isn't just about patents (though those can help). It's about building a *moat* – a sustainable competitive advantage. This could be network effects (the product becomes more valuable as more people use it), proprietary data, strong brand reputation, or switching costs.  Consider how Zoom’s focus on video quality and reliability, combined with a rapidly expanding user base during the pandemic, created a strong competitive advantage.
    * **Engineering Implication:** Consider architectural decisions that reinforce durability. Can you build a platform that allows for continuous innovation and adaptation? Can you leverage data in a way that creates a unique advantage? Think about how easy or difficult it would be for a competitor to replicate your technology.  Building a system with robust APIs and integrations can also create “switching costs” for users.
* **Focus on Product, Not Just Sales:** Sales and marketing are important, but they can't compensate for a fundamentally flawed product. A truly exceptional product *attracts* customers through word-of-mouth and organic growth. This means focusing on creating a delightful user experience, solving a real pain point, and delivering consistent value.
    * **Engineering Implication:** Prioritize quality, reliability, and performance. Invest in user research and usability testing. Build a product that people genuinely *love* to use. Don't underestimate the power of a well-designed API or a frictionless onboarding experience. A prime example is Slack, which initially focused on solving the internal communication problems within a small team, prioritizing usability and a seamless experience.

## From Hypothesis to Execution: A Rapid Iteration Cycle

Once you have a basic GTM framework, the real work begins. Here’s a simple loop to follow:

1. **Define your Minimum Viable GTM (MVGTM):** What’s the *smallest* set of actions you can take to test your core GTM hypothesis? This might involve launching a landing page, running a small ad campaign, or conducting user interviews.
2. **Build, Measure, Learn:** Execute your MVGTM, track key metrics (e.g., website traffic, conversion rates, customer acquisition cost), and analyze the results.
3. **Pivot or Persevere:** Based on the data, decide whether to pivot your strategy, refine your messaging, or double down on what’s working.

This loop should be fast – ideally, weeks or even days. The goal is to learn as quickly as possible and avoid spending months building a product that nobody wants. Each pillar of your GTM—niche, durability, and product focus—should inform and be validated by this iterative process. 

## Leading the Charge as an Engineering Manager

As an engineering manager, you’re uniquely positioned to shape the GTM strategy. Here’s how:

* **Demand Customer Interaction:** Ensure your team has regular access to customers – through user research, beta testing, and direct feedback.
* **Push for Data-Driven Decisions:** Challenge assumptions and demand evidence to support GTM decisions.
* **Advocate for a Minimum Viable Approach:** Resist the urge to overbuild and prioritize speed and iteration.
* **Be a Champion for Durability:** Consider the long-term implications of architectural choices and advocate for building a sustainable competitive advantage.

A successful GTM isn’t a marketing tactic; it’s a fundamental part of building a thriving product. By embracing a data-driven, customer-focused approach, and by actively shaping the strategy from the beginning, engineering managers can play a critical role in ensuring that their teams build products that not only solve problems but also create lasting value. 

To get started, schedule a meeting with your product and marketing teams to discuss your Minimum Viable GTM and identify the first experiment you'll run.
