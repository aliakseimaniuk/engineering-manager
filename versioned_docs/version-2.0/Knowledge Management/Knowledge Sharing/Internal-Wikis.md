# Internal Wikis

For over two decades, I've seen knowledge management practices come and go. Shiny new tools are often touted as the solution, but the most enduring – and often the *most* effective – solutions are surprisingly simple. One such solution? The humble internal wiki. 

Too often relegated to the “documentation dump” or treated as an afterthought, internal wikis are actually a powerful engine for engineering velocity, team health, and scalable growth. They aren't just about *having* knowledge; they're about *accessing* and *activating* it. In this post, I'll share why wikis remain vital, how to build one that *people actually use*, and strategies to ensure its long-term success.

## The Problem with Tacit Knowledge

We talk a lot about technical debt, but what about *knowledge* debt? In any growing engineering organization, a huge amount of critical information lives *only* in people’s heads. “Who knows how to deploy the X service?” “Where did we decide on the architecture for Y?” These questions often lead to frustrating Slack threads, context switching, and ultimately, wasted time. Studies on context switching consistently demonstrate significant productivity losses – often exceeding 20% – highlighting the real cost of relying on undocumented tribal knowledge.

This "tacit knowledge" is incredibly fragile. What happens when that key person leaves the company? Or goes on vacation? Or simply forgets the intricate details after working on something else for a while? That knowledge, and all the effort that went into acquiring it, is effectively lost.

## Why Wikis Still Matter (When Everything Else is Trying to Replace Them)

You might ask, "With tools like Slack, Confluence, and even GitHub READMEs, why bother with a dedicated wiki?" Here's the breakdown:

* **Centralized, Structured Knowledge:** While Slack is great for quick questions, it's a terrible place to *find* information later. GitHub READMEs are excellent for project-level documentation but often lack the breadth needed for organizational knowledge. Wikis provide a central, structured repository for *everything*—from onboarding guides to architectural decisions to post-incident reviews.
* **Discoverability:** A well-organized wiki makes information easily searchable and discoverable. Think of it as an internal search engine for your team’s collective brain.
* **Ownership & Evolution:** Wikis are *designed* for collaborative editing. This means knowledge isn’t static; it evolves with the team. Everyone can contribute, improving accuracy and completeness over time.
* **Reduced Interruptions:** A comprehensive wiki empowers engineers to self-serve information, reducing the need to interrupt colleagues with repetitive questions.

## Building a Wiki People Actually *Use*

Okay, you're convinced. Now what? Here's how to build a wiki that doesn't become a digital ghost town:

1. **Choose the Right Tool:** Options abound – from simple solutions like Wiki.js to more robust platforms like Confluence. Consider your team size, budget, and technical expertise. I've seen success with both, but for many startups, a lightweight, open-source solution like Wiki.js offers a great balance of features and simplicity. (And you can even leverage GitHub issues for comments and versioning!).
2. **Start Small, Focus on Pain Points:** Don't try to document everything at once. Identify the biggest knowledge gaps and focus your initial efforts there. For example:
    * **Onboarding:** A clear onboarding guide is invaluable for new hires.
    * **Runbooks:** Document common operational procedures and troubleshooting steps.
    * **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** Capture the rationale behind key technical decisions. (This is *huge* for preventing architectural drift).
3. **Establish Clear Ownership and Guidelines:** Assign owners to specific sections of the wiki to ensure content is kept up-to-date. Create simple style guides to promote consistency. (Show designs, assets, and style guides as examples).
4. **Make it Part of the Workflow:** Integrate wiki updates into your existing processes. For example:
    * **Post-Incident Reviews:** Document lessons learned in the wiki.
    * **Code Reviews:** Link to relevant wiki pages in pull requests.
    * **Design Reviews:** Document design decisions and rationale.
5. **Lead by Example:** Engineering managers *must* actively contribute to the wiki. If you don't prioritize it, your team won't either.

## Maintaining Momentum: The Long Game

Building a wiki is just the first step. Maintaining it requires ongoing effort. It's an investment, and like any investment, it requires consistent nurturing.

* **Regular Audits:** Periodically review content to ensure it’s accurate and up-to-date.
* **Gamification (Optional):** Consider rewarding contributions to incentivize participation.
* **Analytics:** Track wiki usage to identify knowledge gaps and areas for improvement. (Are people actually *searching* for the information you're documenting?)
* **Promote it!** Remind your team that the wiki is the go-to source for information.

## Tools to Consider

There are many excellent tools available for building an internal wiki. Some popular options include:

* **Wiki.js:** A lightweight, open-source wiki built on Node.js.
* **Confluence:** A robust, feature-rich wiki from Atlassian.
* **readme.com:** A documentation platform with wiki-like features.
* **Basecamp:** A project management tool with built-in documentation capabilities.
* **Hashnode:** A blogging platform that can be used as a wiki.


**In conclusion:** Internal wikis aren't a flashy new technology, but they remain a profoundly effective tool for knowledge management. When built and maintained thoughtfully, they can unlock engineering velocity, improve team health, and build a more resilient, scalable organization. Visualize this flow within your team – turning tacit knowledge into shared understanding and unlocking engineering velocity. Don't underestimate the power of a well-curated, accessible, and actively maintained knowledge base.  Start by identifying one key knowledge gap in your organization and documenting it in a shared wiki this week.
