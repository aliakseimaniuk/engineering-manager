# Measuring DEI Progress

I recently spoke with an engineering leader who confessed her team was *exhausted* by DEI initiatives. They’d hit representation targets, implemented unconscious bias training, and yet, felt little had fundamentally changed. This frustration is common. For years, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives have often felt like ticking boxes – hitting representation targets without truly shifting the underlying culture. As engineering leaders, we *know* that a diverse team isn’t just “the right thing to do” – it’s a force multiplier for innovation, problem-solving, and ultimately, building better products. But simply *wanting* diversity isn’t enough. We need to move beyond vanity metrics and start measuring *progress* – real, meaningful shifts in equity and inclusion within our engineering organizations.

This isn’t about implementing complex, costly programs or obsessing over numbers for numbers' sake. It’s about a fundamental shift in *how* we measure success. Here’s a breakdown of how to do that, moving beyond surface-level metrics and toward actionable insights.

## The Problem with Traditional DEI Metrics

Let’s be honest: the first metrics we often look at are easy to collect, but rarely tell the full story. These include:

* **Representation by Gender/Race/Ethnicity:** While important as a baseline, representation alone doesn't indicate inclusion. A team *can* be diverse yet deeply inequitable.
* **Hiring Rates:** Increasing diverse hires is great, but what happens *after* they join? Are they given the same opportunities for growth and advancement?
* **Participation in DEI Training:** Attending a workshop doesn’t magically change behavior. It’s a starting point, but doesn't measure impact.

These metrics are *outputs* – what we *see* happening. We need to focus on *outcomes* – the lived experiences of our engineers.  

## Shifting to Outcome-Based Measurement: The Three Pillars

I’ve found it helpful to frame DEI progress around three interconnected pillars: **Representation, Belonging, and Advancement.**  Measuring each pillar requires different approaches, but all are essential for a holistic view.

**1. Representation – Beyond the Numbers:**

Yes, tracking demographic data is still crucial. But go deeper.

* **Pipeline Analysis:** Where are you losing diverse candidates in the hiring process? Are your job descriptions unintentionally biased? (Tools like Textio and Ongig can help with this – explore options to find what fits your needs!).
* **Intersectionality:** Don't just look at single dimensions of diversity. How do different identities intersect and create unique experiences?  
* **Distribution Across Roles:**  Are diverse engineers concentrated in certain roles or levels?  A lack of diversity in leadership positions is a critical signal.

**2. Belonging – The Hardest Metric to Capture**

This is where things get tricky. Belonging is subjective, but it’s arguably the *most* important indicator of a healthy and inclusive culture. How do you measure something you can’t see?

* **Regular Pulse Surveys:** Short, frequent surveys (monthly or quarterly) focused on questions like: "Do you feel comfortable voicing your opinions in team meetings?", "Do you believe your contributions are valued?", “Do you feel psychologically safe on your team?”. Anonymity is critical. Research on employee engagement supports the use of frequent pulse surveys to gauge team sentiment.
* **Stay Interviews:**  Go beyond annual performance reviews and have regular conversations with team members about their experiences, what’s working well, and what could be improved.
* **Qualitative Feedback:** Encourage open dialogue in team meetings and one-on-ones.  Actively *listen* for patterns of exclusion or microaggressions.
* **Inclusive Leadership Assessments:**  Evaluate how effectively managers are creating inclusive environments.  360-degree feedback can be valuable here.

**3. Advancement – Ensuring Equitable Growth**

Representation is only meaningful if diverse engineers have equal opportunities to grow and advance within the organization.

* **Promotion Rates:**  Are promotion rates equitable across all demographic groups?  Investigate any disparities.
* **Access to High-Visibility Projects:**  Are diverse engineers being given opportunities to work on challenging and impactful projects that will advance their careers?
* **Mentorship & Sponsorship:**  Are there robust mentorship and sponsorship programs to support the development of diverse engineers?
* **Participation in leadership development programs:** Ensure diverse engineers are nominated for and participate in leadership development programs.

## From Data to Action: The Continuous Improvement Loop

Collecting data is only the first step.  The real value comes from using that data to drive meaningful change.

* **Transparency:** Share DEI data (aggregated and anonymized) with the team. This builds trust and accountability.
* **Action Planning:**  Based on the data, develop specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals.
* **Regular Review:**  Track progress against goals and adjust your strategy as needed.  
* **Iterate:**  DEI is not a one-time fix. It’s a continuous improvement process.

## Final Thoughts

Measuring DEI progress is not about hitting arbitrary targets or chasing good PR. It’s about building a truly inclusive engineering organization where every engineer feels valued, respected, and empowered to do their best work. We know this work isn’t always easy, and challenging conversations are often necessary. This requires a shift in mindset – from focusing on outputs to understanding outcomes and fostering equity and inclusion. It's a challenging journey, but one that is essential for the success of our teams and the innovation of our industry.
