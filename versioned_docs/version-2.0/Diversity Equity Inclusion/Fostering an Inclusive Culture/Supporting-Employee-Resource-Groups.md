# Supporting Employee Resource Groups

For years, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) were traditionally seen as “nice-to-haves” – well-intentioned groups that hosted lunch-and-learns and celebrated heritage months. While those activities are valuable, ERGs are now demonstrating they are *essential* to attracting, retaining, and growing diverse engineering talent. I recently spoke with a VP of Engineering who admitted his initial reluctance to invest in ERGs, fearing they’d be just another ‘add-on’ to already stretched teams.  However, after seeing a significant drop in retention among engineers from underrepresented groups, he realized the critical role ERGs could play.  As an engineering leader, simply *allowing* ERGs to exist isn’t enough. True support requires intentionality, resource allocation, and a shift in how you view their impact.

I’ve seen this evolution firsthand, from early days where ERGs felt like an add-on to now, where they are instrumental in shaping inclusive product development and fostering a sense of belonging. Here’s how you can move beyond checking boxes and *actually* support your ERGs, based on lessons learned over two decades in this field.

## Why ERGs Matter to Engineering Leaders – It's Not Just About "Doing the Right Thing"

Let's be blunt: while ethical considerations are paramount, ERGs also deliver significant business value. According to a recent Deloitte study, companies with mature ERG programs report a 26% increase in innovation. Here’s how:

* **Improved Retention:** Engineers from underrepresented groups often leave organizations due to feelings of isolation or lack of support. ERGs provide a community, mentorship, and a voice.
* **Innovation & Product Impact:** ERGs can provide invaluable insights into the needs of diverse customer bases, leading to more inclusive and innovative products. They can act as “early warning systems” for potential usability issues or unintended consequences of design choices.
* **Enhanced Recruitment:** A strong ERG presence signals to potential candidates that your organization values diversity and inclusion.
* **Leadership Development:** ERGs offer opportunities for members to develop leadership skills, project management experience, and public speaking abilities.

## Moving From Permission to Partnership: What Active Support Looks Like

Here's a breakdown of actionable steps, categorized for clarity:

**1. Resource Allocation – Show Me the Money (and Time)**

This is where many organizations fall short. ERGs can't thrive on volunteer hours alone.

* **Dedicated Budget:** Allocate a dedicated budget for ERG activities. This can cover event costs, speaker fees, training materials, or even sponsoring external events. Think beyond pizza parties – invest in professional development opportunities for ERG members.
* **Protected Time:** Explicitly allow employees to dedicate a *portion* of their work time to ERG activities. This could be a few hours per month or a dedicated “ERG day” per quarter. This signals that ERG participation is valued and won’t be penalized. (I’ve seen this work well with a "10% time" policy, mirroring some innovative companies' approaches to personal projects. It's important to acknowledge that implementing this requires careful planning and workload management to avoid overburdening teams.)
* **Executive Sponsorship:** Pair each ERG with a senior leader who acts as a champion, advocate, and resource. This leader should actively participate in ERG events and help navigate organizational roadblocks.

**2. Genuine Collaboration – Listen, Amplify, and Act**

Don't treat ERGs as a source of free consulting. Collaboration should be a two-way street.

* **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule regular meetings with ERG leaders to understand their goals, challenges, and how you can support them.
* **Incorporate ERG Feedback:** Actively solicit ERG input on key engineering initiatives, such as product design, hiring practices, and team culture. Don’t just ask for feedback; *demonstrate* that you’ve considered it.
* **Amplify ERG Voices:** Provide ERGs with a platform to share their insights and expertise with the broader organization. This could involve presentations, blog posts, or internal communications.

**3. Defining Clear Boundaries & Expectations – Avoiding “ERG Fatigue”**

While support is vital, it's equally important to establish clear boundaries.

* **Defined Scope:** Help ERGs define their scope and focus. Trying to do too much can lead to burnout.
* **Realistic Expectations:** Don’t expect ERGs to solve all of your DEI challenges. They are a valuable *part* of the solution, but they can’t operate in a vacuum.
* **Clear Communication Channels:** Establish clear communication channels between ERGs, HR, and engineering leadership. This ensures that issues are addressed promptly and effectively.

## A Word on Measuring Impact

It’s tempting to focus solely on “outputs” (number of events held, members recruited). But true impact is measured by *outcomes*. Consider tracking:

* **Retention rates of employees who participate in ERGs.**
* **Employee engagement scores, particularly among underrepresented groups.**
* **Diversity metrics within your engineering teams.**
* **Improvements in product accessibility and inclusivity (e.g., number of accessibility-focused features implemented based on ERG feedback).**

Supporting ERGs isn't just about "doing the right thing." It's a strategic investment in your people, your products, and your future. As engineering leaders, we have a responsibility to create inclusive environments where everyone can thrive. By truly partnering with ERGs, we can unlock the full potential of our ERGs and build truly diverse and innovative engineering teams.

**Start Today:** Schedule a meeting with your ERG leaders this week to understand their current priorities and how you can best support them.
