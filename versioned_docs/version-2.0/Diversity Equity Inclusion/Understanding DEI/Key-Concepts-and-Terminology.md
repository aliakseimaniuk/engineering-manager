# Key Concepts And Terminology

For over two decades leading engineering teams, I’ve seen countless initiatives launched with the best intentions. Many focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), and while enthusiasm is high, a frustrating pattern often emerges: people talk *past* each other. They use the same words, but mean fundamentally different things. This isn’t malicious; it’s a natural consequence of complex concepts lacking shared understanding. DEI isn't just about *doing* the right thing – it's about building a foundation of *shared understanding* to enable effective action.

This article isn’t about prescribing a single, rigid definition for every DEI term. Instead, it’s about highlighting the critical need for a common terminology *within your team* and offering a framework for establishing it. Think of it like architectural diagrams for a complex system – they don't dictate the implementation, but ensure everyone understands the components and their relationships.

## The Problem with Ambiguity

It's easy for misunderstandings to arise when discussing complex topics. I recently observed an engineering team debating a new initiative, only to realize they were using “inclusion” to mean vastly different things – one focusing on representation in leadership, the other on day-to-day team interactions. This highlights a crucial point: when it comes to DEI, ambiguity can derail even the most well-intentioned efforts.

Terms like "diversity," "equity," and "inclusion" are often treated as interchangeable, or worse, poorly defined. Here's how that ambiguity manifests in engineering teams:

* **Misaligned Goals:** One engineer might define “diversity” as simply headcount representation, while another focuses on psychological safety and belonging. This leads to initiatives that *look* diverse but don’t address underlying systemic issues.
* **Ineffective Feedback:** If “inclusion” isn’t clearly understood, feedback like “This person isn’t included” is useless. What *specifically* does “not included” look like? Are they being overlooked in meetings? Are their ideas dismissed?
* **Frustration & Cynicism:** Constantly debating definitions and feeling misunderstood erodes trust and breeds cynicism. People disengage, believing DEI is just another HR exercise in buzzwords.

## Building Your Team’s DEI "Architecture"

Here's a practical approach to establish a shared terminology. I recommend adapting this as a team exercise, not a top-down mandate.

**1. Core Definitions – Start with the Fundamentals**

Don't reinvent the wheel. Leverage established definitions, but *critically discuss them as a team*. Here’s a starting point, with links to further resources:

* **Diversity:** The presence of differences within a group, encompassing dimensions like race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, neurodiversity, and more. *Important nuance*: Diversity is often about representation, but it’s only the first step.
* **Equity:** Recognizing that individuals start from different places and require different levels of support to achieve fair outcomes. Equity isn't about treating everyone the same; it's about providing what each person *needs* to succeed.
* **Inclusion:** Creating an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and has equal access to opportunities. It’s about ensuring all voices are heard and considered.
* **Belonging:** The feeling of being accepted and valued for who you are, allowing you to bring your authentic self to work. Belonging goes beyond inclusion; it’s about psychological safety and a sense of connection.

**2. Operationalize the Concepts – Move Beyond Theory**

Defining terms is good, but making them *actionable* is critical. For each core concept, brainstorm specific behaviors and indicators.

For example:

* **Equity (in the context of code reviews):** Instead of simply saying “Everyone gets equal review time,” ask: “Are we ensuring that junior engineers receive constructive feedback, not just critical assessment? Are we actively seeking out diverse perspectives during review?”
* **Inclusion (in team meetings):** "What are the observable behaviors that indicate someone *isn’t* being included? Are we calling on the same people repeatedly? Are we interrupting certain team members? Are we providing opportunities for asynchronous contribution?"

**3. Document and Iterate – Treat it as a Living Document**

Create a team "DEI Glossary" – a shared document (Google Doc, Wiki page, etc.) that outlines the agreed-upon definitions and indicators. This isn’t a one-time exercise. Regularly revisit and refine the glossary based on team experiences and feedback. New situations will arise, requiring new definitions or clarification of existing ones.

**4. Address "Dangerous Breaks" – Be Aware of Shifting Meanings**

Just like in software development, shifts in terminology can occur. Pay attention to instances where individuals use DEI terms in ways that fundamentally contradict the team’s agreed-upon definitions. Address these "dangerous breaks" constructively, using them as opportunities for learning and clarification. This requires vulnerability and a willingness to challenge assumptions.

## Beyond Terminology: The Importance of Continuous Learning

Establishing a shared language is a crucial first step, but it's not enough. DEI is an ongoing journey, requiring continuous learning and self-reflection. Encourage your team to explore resources, attend workshops, and engage in open and honest conversations.

Remember, DEI isn’t just about ticking boxes; it’s about building a more just and equitable workplace for everyone. And a shared language is the foundation upon which that future is built.

**To get started, consider scheduling a 30-minute team discussion to review the core definitions provided in this article. Assigning a team member to create a draft DEI glossary based on this framework is another excellent first step. Remember that building a shared understanding of DEI is an ongoing process, not a one-time fix.**
