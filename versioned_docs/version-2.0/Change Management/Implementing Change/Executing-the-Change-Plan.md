# Executing The Change Plan

Change is a constant in software engineering. But according to a recent study by the Project Management Institute, nearly 70% of organizational change initiatives fail. Why? Often, it's not the *vision* that's lacking, but the *execution*. A well-defined change plan is crucial, but it’s only half the battle. Turning that plan into tangible progress is where most initiatives stumble. After two decades leading engineering teams, I've learned that successful execution isn’t about flawless planning (though that helps!), it’s about a mindset shift, incorporating developer guidance early, and accepting that *a good plan, even an imperfect one, is better than no plan at all.*

## The Pitfalls of Top-Down Change

Too often, change initiatives in engineering are handed down as fully-formed specifications. Product or leadership outlines *how* things should be built, leaving engineers to simply implement. This approach breeds resentment, stifles innovation, and often leads to technical debt. Engineers are problem-solvers; they *want* to contribute to the solution, not just be order-takers.

I remember one particularly frustrating refactor at a previous company. Leadership mandated a complete rewrite of a core service, outlining the new architecture in excruciating detail. The team felt unheard, and many quietly predicted failure.  The atmosphere was palpable – a sense of being dictated to rather than collaborating on a critical initiative. We lost months of momentum and valuable resources. The project ultimately stalled – not because of technical impossibility, but because the team lacked ownership and didn't see the rationale behind the rigid specifications.  

## Shift the Focus: Business Requirements, Not Implementation Details

The key to avoiding this trap is to focus your specifications on *what* needs to be achieved, not *how*. Think in terms of business requirements and desired outcomes. Instead of saying, "Implement a new authentication system using OAuth 2.0," try, "Improve security and user experience by streamlining the login process." 

This seemingly small shift unlocks a wealth of benefits:

* **Empowered Engineers:** Engineers can leverage their expertise to determine the best technical solution.
* **Innovation:** They’re free to explore creative approaches you might not have considered.
* **Reduced Risk:** Early input from those closest to the code can identify potential roadblocks.

This empowerment isn't just about being "nice" to your engineers; it's about tapping into their deep technical expertise to deliver a higher-quality solution. When engineers feel ownership, they're more invested in the outcome and more likely to identify and mitigate potential risks.

## The Power of Timeboxed Explorations

Before finalizing any plan, especially a significant change, *include developers in the planning stage*. And don’t just ask for their feedback – give them time to *explore*. I’ve found timeboxed explorations to be incredibly effective.

Here's how it works:

1. **Define the Problem:** Clearly articulate the business problem the change aims to solve.
2. **Assign Exploration Teams:** Form small teams of engineers to investigate potential solutions.
3. **Timebox the Exploration:** Set a strict deadline for the exploration phase.
4. **Focus on Feasibility & Options:** The goal isn't to build anything, but to identify potential solutions, assess their feasibility, and highlight potential challenges.
5. **Share Findings:** Teams present their findings to stakeholders, informing the final plan.

This approach doesn’t eliminate risk, but it dramatically reduces it by surfacing potential issues *before* significant investment is made. It also creates buy-in and fosters a sense of ownership.

## Incremental Advances – Building Momentum with Smaller Steps

Large-scale changes are inherently risky and difficult to manage. Whenever possible, break down the change into smaller, manageable increments.  Focus on delivering value through iterative improvements rather than attempting a massive overhaul. By tackling smaller pieces, engineers gain more autonomy and receive faster feedback, fostering a more agile and responsive development process. 

This approach offers several advantages:

* **Reduced Risk:** Smaller changes are easier to test and rollback.
* **Faster Feedback:** You can get feedback on your progress more quickly.
* **Continuous Value:** You can deliver value to users more frequently.

Think of it like climbing a staircase instead of trying to jump to the top floor. Each step is manageable, and you make steady progress toward your goal.

## A Good Plan, Even an Imperfect One, is Better Than No Plan

Finally, remember that perfection is the enemy of progress. It’s tempting to wait until you have a perfect plan before you start, but that’s a recipe for paralysis. Get something down on paper, start experimenting, and iterate based on what you learn. 

Don't fall into analysis paralysis. Your initial plan will likely need adjustments, and that's okay. The important thing is to start moving forward.

**In conclusion:** Executing a change plan successfully requires a shift in mindset. Focus on business requirements, empower your engineers, embrace iterative progress, and don’t be afraid to start with an imperfect plan. By incorporating these principles, you can increase your chances of delivering impactful change and building a more resilient and adaptable engineering organization. What does this look like in practice? It means fostering a culture of collaboration, encouraging experimentation, and prioritizing continuous learning. 

**To put this into action, consider these questions:**

* What’s one change you can make *today* to empower your engineers?
* How can you incorporate timeboxed explorations into your next planning cycle?
