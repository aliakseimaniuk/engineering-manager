# Managing Resistance

Resistance to change. It’s the unspoken undercurrent in nearly every significant initiative, and as an engineering leader, you *will* encounter it. I recall leading a database migration project where initial resistance from the team nearly derailed the entire effort. Frustration stemmed from a perceived lack of input into the technology choice and concerns about the learning curve. By actively listening to their concerns and incorporating their feedback into the implementation plan, we transformed skeptics into advocates. It’s rarely a malicious act; more often, it’s a natural human response to the unknown, a fear of disruption, or a legitimate concern about how change will impact work, careers, or the team’s hard-won stability. Over two decades leading engineering teams, I’ve learned that simply acknowledging resistance isn’t sufficient. You need a proactive, empathetic, and strategically sound approach to navigate it.

This isn’t about steamrolling objections. It's about understanding the *why* behind the resistance and, more importantly, creating an environment where constructive dialogue can flourish. Let's dive into some practical strategies.

## Beyond "Just Do It": Understanding the Roots of Resistance

Before you formulate a response, diagnose the source. Resistance isn’t monolithic. Here are a few common culprits:

* **Loss of Control:** Change often feels like something *happening to* people, not *with* them. Engineers, particularly, value autonomy and control over their work.
* **Threat to Expertise:** New technologies or processes can make existing skills feel obsolete, triggering anxiety.
* **Increased Workload (Real or Perceived):** Change inevitably involves learning curves and extra effort, at least initially. Teams already stretched thin will rightly question adding more to their plates.
* **Lack of Trust:** If past changes were poorly executed or didn’t deliver on promises, trust erodes, and resistance hardens.
* **Genuine Concerns About Feasibility:** Sometimes, the resistance isn’t emotional – it's practical. The proposed change *might* genuinely be a bad idea.

## Transforming Resistance into Collaboration: A Framework for Engagement

Once you understand the roots, move beyond simply *addressing* objections to actively *engaging* with those expressing them. Here’s a framework I’ve found effective:

1. **Listen, *Really* Listen:** This seems obvious, but it's the most overlooked step. Create safe spaces – one-on-ones, small group discussions, even anonymous feedback channels – where people can voice concerns without fear of retribution. Don’t interrupt, defend, or immediately offer solutions. Just listen and validate their feelings. Phrases like "I understand why you feel that way" or "That's a valid point" can go a long way. For example, during a recent rollout of a new CI/CD pipeline, I held individual conversations with each engineer to understand their initial reactions. Simply allowing them to voice their concerns – even if they were skeptical – immediately diffused much of the tension.

2. **Acknowledge and Validate:** Don’t dismiss concerns as “negative” or “unhelpful.” Even if you disagree, acknowledge the legitimacy of their perspective. For example, “I understand your concern about the learning curve with the new framework. It *will* require extra effort, and we need to account for that.”

3. **Seek to Understand, Not to Convince:** Ask clarifying questions. “What specifically about this change concerns you the most?” or “What would need to happen for you to feel more comfortable with this?” Focus on understanding their perspective, not on immediately convincing them you’re right.

4. **Collaborate on Solutions:** This is where you move from listening to action. “Okay, knowing your concerns, how can we address them? What changes can we make to mitigate the risks and make this transition smoother?” Involve the resistors in finding solutions. This transforms them from opponents to collaborators.

5. **Communicate Transparently:** Be honest about the challenges and uncertainties. Don’t sugarcoat things. Explain the *why* behind the change, the benefits, and the potential downsides. Regular, open communication builds trust and reduces anxiety.

## Co-Evolving with the Problem: The Agile Imperative

Often, change initiatives are complex and impacted by factors beyond your immediate influence. This is where an Agile mindset becomes crucial.

Rigid, top-down change management rarely works. Instead, embrace iteration and feedback. Think of the change as a series of experiments. Implement small changes, gather feedback, and adjust your approach accordingly.

This “co-evolution” approach does several things:

* **Reduces Risk:** Smaller changes are less disruptive and easier to course-correct.
* **Demonstrates Responsiveness:** Showing that you’re listening and adapting builds trust.
* **Empowers the Team:** Involving the team in the process fosters ownership and commitment.

Embracing an Agile approach is *essential* when dealing with complex change initiatives and external constraints, allowing you to continuously refine your strategy based on real-world feedback and adapt to unforeseen challenges.

## The Bottom Line: It's About People, Not Just Process

Managing resistance isn’t about suppressing dissent or forcing compliance. It's about recognizing that change is inherently unsettling for people, and responding with empathy, transparency, and a willingness to collaborate. It’s about fostering an environment where people feel safe to voice their concerns, contribute to the solution, and ultimately, embrace the future.

Remember, the goal isn’t just to *implement* change, but to *ensure everyone feels invested in the outcome*. And that requires genuine leadership, not just technical expertise.

**Key Takeaways for Managing Resistance:**

* **Diagnose the Root Cause:** Understand *why* people are resisting.
* **Listen Actively:** Create a safe space for open communication.
* **Collaborate on Solutions:** Involve resistors in finding solutions.
* **Communicate Transparently:** Be honest about challenges and benefits.
* **Embrace Iteration:** Treat change as an experiment and adapt as needed.

This week, commit to actively listening to one team member who has expressed concerns about a new initiative. Focus on understanding their perspective without interruption.
