# Reorganizations

Reorganizations. The very word can send shivers down the spines of even the most seasoned engineers and engineering managers. A staggering 70% of organizational change initiatives fail, often due to poor planning and execution. They’re often seen as disruptive, anxiety-inducing events, and frankly, *many* are handled poorly. After two decades leading engineering teams through growth, acquisition, and restructuring, I’ve learned that a well-executed reorganization isn’t about minimizing disruption (that’s often impossible), but about *maximizing clarity* and preserving the productive core of your team. 

This isn’t about theoretical change management; it’s about practical steps you can take *right now* to navigate the rapids and come out stronger on the other side.

## Why Reorganizations Happen (and Why They Often Fail)

Let’s be honest: reorganizations rarely stem from a desire to make things *better* in the abstract. They're usually a reaction to a problem – a shift in business strategy, a failed initiative, rapid growth exposing structural weaknesses, or (sadly, all too common) a crisis. The Enron scandal serves as a stark reminder: a lack of transparency and accountability can lead to catastrophic failure, sometimes requiring a crisis for correction. But waiting for bankruptcy isn’t a strategy. Proactive reorganization, addressing emerging issues before they become existential, is far more effective.

The failure rate is high. Why? Often, it boils down to a few key mistakes:

*   **Lack of Clear Rationale:** Announcing a reorganization without a compelling, transparent explanation leaves teams feeling lost and distrustful.
*   **Top-Down Dictation:** Imposing structures without input from those who will be most affected breeds resentment and stifles innovation.
*   **Ignoring the Human Impact:** Focusing solely on charts and reporting lines while neglecting the emotional toll on individuals is a recipe for disaster.
*   **Treating it as a One-Time Event:** Reorganization isn't a "project" with a finish line. It requires ongoing communication, adaptation, and course correction.

## A Framework for Leading Through Reorganization

Here’s a pragmatic approach, built on principles of transparency, empowerment, and continuous improvement:

**1. Diagnose, Don’t Just React:** Before *any* structural changes, understand the *root causes* of the problem. Are you reorganizing because of technical debt, skill gaps, a shifting market, or a lack of clear ownership? Tools like the "5 Whys" can be invaluable here. Don’t treat symptoms; address the underlying issues. Toys "R" Us’s “TRU Transformation” recognized the need to fix “foundational issues,” not just put a band-aid on declining sales.

**2. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate:** This cannot be overstated. Be radically transparent about *why* the reorganization is happening, *what* the goals are, and *how* it will impact individuals. Hold all-hands meetings, smaller team sessions, and one-on-ones. Answer questions honestly, even the difficult ones. Don't shy away from acknowledging uncertainty. Remember that political considerations are often at play, and navigating these complexities requires empathy and diplomacy.

**3. Co-Create the New Structure (Where Possible):** While some reorganization decisions are non-negotiable, actively solicit input from your team, especially those directly impacted. Can teams self-organize to address specific challenges? Can individuals take on new roles that align with their strengths and interests? This builds buy-in and reduces resistance. Think of it as collaborative design, not an autocratic decree.

**4. Focus on Clarity of Ownership:** One of the biggest benefits of a reorganization is defining clear lines of accountability. Ensure everyone understands their roles, responsibilities, and reporting structures. Use org charts (a simple visual aid here is very effective) and document key decision-making processes. Ambiguity is the enemy of execution.

**5. Embrace Incremental Changes:** Resist the urge to overhaul everything at once. A phased approach allows you to test assumptions, gather feedback, and adjust course as needed. The idea here is to make incremental advances, constantly refining the structure based on real-world results.  Iterative change allows for faster adaptation and reduces risk. You can always iterate, but undoing a massive, poorly planned reorganization is a nightmare.

**6. Support Your People:** Reorganization is stressful. Be empathetic and provide support to your team members. Offer opportunities for professional development, mentoring, and career counseling. Acknowledge their contributions and celebrate their successes. Remember, people are your most valuable asset.




## Beyond the Chart: Long-Term Sustainability

A successful reorganization isn’t just about drawing a new org chart. It’s about building a more resilient, adaptable organization.

*   **Retrospectives are Key:** After each phase of the reorganization, conduct a retrospective (similar to agile sprint retrospectives). These sessions, focused on identifying what worked well, what could be improved, and what lessons were learned, are essential for continuous improvement and adaptation.
*   **Foster a Culture of Continuous Improvement:** Encourage experimentation and learning. Empower teams to identify and address problems proactively.
*   **Recognize and support Adaptability:** Celebrate individuals and teams who embrace change and demonstrate a willingness to learn and grow.



**Key Principles for Navigating Reorganization:**

*   **Clarity:** Ensure everyone understands the *why*, *what*, and *how* of the changes.
*   **Communication:** Be transparent, honest, and frequent in your communication.
*   **Collaboration:** Involve your team in the process whenever possible.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Learn from each phase and adapt as needed.

Reorganizations are rarely easy. But by focusing on clarity, transparency, and empowerment, you can navigate the rapids and emerge with a stronger, more resilient engineering organization. It’s not about avoiding disruption; it’s about channeling it into positive change. What’s one step you can take *today* to improve clarity within your engineering organization?
