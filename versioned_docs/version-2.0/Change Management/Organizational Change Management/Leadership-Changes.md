# Leadership Changes

Leadership changes are inevitable. In fact, they’re a constant in the modern workplace, particularly in tech. But inevitability doesn’t make them *easy*. As engineering managers, we don't just *experience* these shifts; we’re on the front lines of managing the fallout – the uncertainty, the fear, and the potential loss of momentum. I've seen this play out countless times over my 20+ years, and the key isn’t to *prevent* change (you can’t), but to navigate it with empathy, transparency, and a renewed focus on what truly matters: your team. This article will explore how to do just that, focusing on building trust and restoring momentum during turbulent times.

This isn’t about “change management” in the fluffy, process-oriented sense. It’s about *leadership* during instability, and recognizing that sometimes, the most effective thing you can do is be a stabilizing force. I'll share some hard-won lessons, focusing on scenarios that go beyond the typical “new manager onboarding.” We'll address the sticky situations – the layoffs, the perceived unfairness, and the erosion of trust.

## The Anatomy of Disruption

Let’s be honest: leadership changes rarely happen in a vacuum. Often, they’re symptoms of broader issues – restructuring, financial pressures, or strategic pivots. The scenario outlined – a lead leaving, followed by layoffs and questionable retention decisions – is alarmingly common. A strong performer being let go while a less effective, but articulate, colleague remains sends a powerful – and damaging – message. It screams that *delivery* isn’t valued as much as *presentation*.

Why does this matter to *you*, the engineering manager? Because your team will be dissecting it. They'll be questioning their own value, wondering about the future, and losing faith in the organization. Ignoring this undercurrent is a recipe for disaster.

## Beyond "Transparency": Genuine Care is the Foundation

The knee-jerk reaction to a disruptive change is usually “more communication!”  And yes, communication is vital. But simply *telling* people what’s happening isn’t enough. It’s the *how* and the *why* that truly matter.

I've found that "genuine care" is the most effective management tool. It sounds soft, but it’s brutally effective. This means:

* **Acknowledge the Pain:** Don’t gloss over the difficulty. Say something like, “I know this is unsettling. Losing [colleague’s name] was tough, and it’s natural to feel anxious about the future.” *Example: Instead of saying “We need to move forward,” try “I know this is tough, and it’s okay to feel frustrated.”*
* **Explain What You *Can* Explain:** You may not have all the answers, but be honest about what you know and what you don't. Don’t speculate or offer false promises. *Example: “I don’t have all the details about the restructuring yet, but I’ll share what I learn as soon as I can.”*
* **Focus on What Remains Constant:** Emphasize the team’s purpose, their current projects, and the value of their work. What *can* you control? Focus relentlessly on that. *Example: “Even with these changes, our commitment to delivering a high-quality product remains the same.”*
* **Listen, Really Listen:** Create space for your team to voice their concerns, fears, and frustrations. Resist the urge to immediately “fix” things. Sometimes, people just need to be heard. *Example: Schedule dedicated 1:1s and actively practice active listening - summarizing their points to ensure understanding.*
* **Advocate for Your Team:** If you see decisions that are detrimental to your team’s morale or productivity, speak up. You’re their voice. *Example: If resources are being unfairly distributed, raise the issue with your manager and advocate for a more equitable solution.*

## The Trap of “Process” and the Caboose Problem

You mentioned the observation that often, we focus on *adhering* to methodologies rather than actually *getting the work done*. I call it “the caboose problem.” Someone, somewhere, insists on being at the end of the train, enforcing rules even if it means derailing progress. This tendency is heightened during times of change, as people cling to processes as a way to regain control. This clinging is often born from a desire for control in an environment that suddenly feels chaotic.

Here’s a hard truth: during disruption, the best process is often *no process*. Be willing to temporarily suspend or modify procedures to prioritize delivery and team well-being. Focus on outcomes, not adherence.

## Retrospectives: Shifting from Team-Level to Organization-Level

This situation begs for a deeper look at how we conduct retrospectives. While team-level retros are valuable for identifying and addressing local issues, a leadership change demands a more holistic approach.

Consider facilitating (or advocating for) organization-level retrospectives. This allows for a broader examination of the changes, their impact, and potential corrective actions that require input from multiple teams and departments. You might encounter resistance - concerns about time commitment or lack of actionable outcomes. Addressing these proactively by framing the retrospective as an investment in future stability and demonstrating a clear plan for translating learnings into action can help.

**Here's a quick framework:**

* **What went well during the transition?** (Identify positive actions and learnings).
* **What didn’t go well?** (Be brutally honest about the challenges).
* **What can we do differently next time?** (Focus on actionable improvements that address systemic issues).
* **What support does the team need *right now*?** (Address immediate concerns and provide resources).

The key is to ensure that corrective actions are assigned to the appropriate level of organizational control. Some issues can be addressed at the team level, while others require leadership intervention.

## The (Uncomfortable) Truth About Care

You said, "The reality is that no manager, anywhere, cares about his subordinates." It's a cynical statement, but it contains a grain of truth. It’s easy to become focused on your own career progression, your own metrics, and your own agendas. However, consciously choosing to prioritize your team’s well-being and development is what sets exceptional leaders apart.

When your team succeeds, you succeed. By investing in their growth and providing them with the support they need, you’re not just doing the right thing; you’re building a stronger, more resilient, and more innovative team that will consistently deliver results.

**Final Thoughts:** Leadership changes are inevitable. But how you navigate them defines you as an engineering manager. By prioritizing genuine care, fostering open communication, and focusing on what truly matters, you can rebuild trust, restore momentum, and guide your team through even the most challenging times.

**This week, schedule a 1:1 with each member of your team to check in and listen to their concerns.**
