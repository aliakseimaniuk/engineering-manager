# Brainstorming

For two decades, I’ve seen countless brainstorming sessions. Some fizzle out after 15 minutes, yielding nothing but a wall covered in vaguely-related buzzwords. Others are surprisingly productive, unlocking innovative solutions that genuinely move the needle. The difference isn’t about *if* you brainstorm, but *how*. Because let's be honest, traditional brainstorming – the free-for-all of ideas – often falls short for engineering teams tackling complex technical challenges. Studies have shown that unstructured brainstorming can actually *hinder* creativity due to factors like evaluation apprehension and conformity.

This isn’t about dismissing brainstorming altogether. It’s about evolving the practice to suit the needs of problem-solving engineers. It’s about moving beyond sticky notes and surface-level ideas to create a culture where genuinely innovative thinking thrives.

## The Problem with "Traditional" Brainstorming

The core tenet of classic brainstorming – defer judgment – sounds great in theory. But in practice, it’s incredibly difficult, especially for engineers. We're trained to analyze, critique, and identify flaws. Asking us *not* to do that feels… unnatural. This often leads to:

* **Surface-Level Ideas:** People hold back truly innovative (and potentially “crazy”) ideas for fear of immediate dismissal.
* **Dominance of Voices:** A few vocal team members can easily overshadow quieter, but potentially brilliant, contributors.
* **Lack of Focus:** Sessions drift without a clear objective, resulting in a chaotic mess of unrelated thoughts.
* **Action Paralysis:** A long list of ideas without a clear path to prioritization and implementation.

I remember leading a team tasked with redesigning a core component of our mobile app. We spent a full hour in a classic brainstorming session, and all we ended up with was a whiteboard full of incremental improvements – things we’d already considered.  It felt like wasted time.  The problem wasn’t that the ideas were *bad*, it was that they weren’t *bold* enough to address the fundamental challenge.

## Structured Brainstorming for Engineers:  Techniques That Work

Here are a few techniques I’ve found significantly more effective with engineering teams.  Consider these as variations on the brainstorming theme, designed to address the shortcomings of the traditional approach.

**1. Brainwriting (6-3-5 Method):** This is my go-to. Each participant writes down three ideas on a piece of paper in five minutes.  Then, they pass their paper to the next person, who builds *on* those ideas. Repeat until everyone has contributed to every paper.  

* **Why it works:**  It levels the playing field, forces building on existing concepts (encouraging iteration), and generates a surprisingly large number of ideas quickly.  It’s also less intimidating for introverted team members. This anonymity also fosters psychological safety, encouraging broader participation.

**2.  Worst Possible Idea:**  Start by asking the team to brainstorm the *worst* possible solutions to the problem. This seemingly counterintuitive approach removes the pressure of coming up with “good” ideas and unlocks creativity.  Often, in the process of identifying bad ideas, surprisingly good ones emerge.

* **Why it works:**  It’s fun, it encourages risk-taking, and it forces you to think outside the box.
* **Example:** "Let's brainstorm the *worst* way to onboard a new developer." We actually discovered that the worst ideas highlighted a critical lack of clear documentation and a convoluted access request process, leading us to prioritize those improvements.

**3.  SCAMPER:** A checklist that prompts you to think about how to improve an existing product or solution by asking questions related to: **S**ubstitute, **C**ombine, **A**dapt, **M**odify/Magnify/Minimize, **P**ut to other uses, **E**liminate, **R**everse.

* **Why it works:** Provides a structured framework to systematically explore different improvement avenues.  Especially useful when you’re stuck in a rut.

**4.  Silent Brainstorming + Dot Voting:**  Have everyone silently write down their ideas on sticky notes for a set amount of time. Then, each person gets a limited number of "dots" (stickers or markers) to vote for the ideas they think have the most potential.

* **Why it works:**  Reduces groupthink, allows everyone to contribute equally, and provides a quick and democratic way to prioritize ideas.

## Beyond the Session: Cultivating a Brainstorming Culture

Brainstorming isn't just about the session itself; it’s about creating an environment where innovative thinking is encouraged and rewarded *all the time*. We know you’re busy, so these techniques are designed to be efficient and deliver tangible results.

* **Psychological Safety:**  This is paramount.  Team members need to feel comfortable sharing ideas, even “crazy” ones, without fear of ridicule or judgment.  Lead by example – share your own early-stage ideas.
* **Dedicated Time:**  Don't just squeeze brainstorming into existing meetings.  Schedule dedicated time for it, and treat it as a valuable activity.
* **Follow-Up:**  Don't let the ideas gather dust.  Assign owners to investigate promising concepts, and track their progress.  
* **Embrace Failure:** Not every idea will be a winner.  View failures as learning opportunities, and celebrate the effort that went into trying something new.

I’ve seen firsthand that consistently applying these principles—structuring brainstorming sessions, fostering psychological safety, and prioritizing follow-up—transforms engineering teams from executors of tasks into generators of innovation.  It's about moving beyond simply ideas to nurturing a culture where exceptional ideas can flourish.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Structure is Key:**  Move beyond free-for-all brainstorming to techniques that address common pitfalls.
* **Psychological Safety Matters:** Create a culture where all voices are heard and experimentation is encouraged.
* **Follow-Up is Essential:**  Don't let great ideas languish—assign ownership and track progress.

Try implementing one of these techniques in your next team meeting and see the difference it makes.
