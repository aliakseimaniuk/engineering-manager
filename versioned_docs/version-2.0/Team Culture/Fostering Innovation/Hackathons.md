# Hackathons

Many engineering leaders view hackathons as “nice-to-haves” – fun team-building events that don’t necessarily contribute to the bottom line. But a strategically-run hackathon can unlock innovation, boost morale, and even address critical business challenges. I’ve seen hackathons transform from discretionary activities to core components of a healthy engineering culture, and I want to share how you can make that happen.

**The Problem with "Fun" as the Sole Metric**

Too often, hackathons are judged solely on whether participants enjoyed themselves and if the energy was positive. Those are *positive* outcomes, but they’re not the *purpose*. If your hackathon doesn’t deliver anything beyond a good time, you’re leaving valuable potential on the table. Think of it like a company offsite – enjoyable, yes, but ideally also productive and aligned to business goals.

**Why Hackathons are Gold for Engineering Managers**

Hackathons offer a unique opportunity to address several key challenges facing engineering managers. First, they provide a safe space for skill development and cross-pollination. Engineers can experiment with technologies they wouldn’t normally touch in their day-to-day work, broadening their skillsets. Critically, these events also force collaboration with colleagues they might not usually work with, breaking down silos and fostering the exchange of ideas. I once saw a junior front-end engineer pair with a seasoned backend architect during a hackathon, resulting in a surprisingly elegant solution to a persistent UI issue.

Furthermore, giving engineers dedicated time to explore unconventional solutions can unlock surprising innovation. A well-scoped hackathon focused on a specific problem area—such as improving onboarding or addressing technical debt—can yield practical prototypes and ideas that directly address business needs. Studies have shown a correlation between dedicated innovation time and increased patent filings and product improvements. [Consider linking to a relevant study here if possible]. 

Beyond innovation and skill development, a successful hackathon builds camaraderie and trust. Working intensely on a shared project, overcoming challenges together, and celebrating successes fosters a stronger team bond. It also demonstrates to engineers that their ideas are valued and that the company invests in their creativity. Finally, pay attention to who steps up during the hackathon. Who takes initiative, mentors others, and drives the project forward? These individuals often possess untapped leadership potential.

**Making Your Hackathon a Success: A Practical Framework**

Here’s how to move beyond the “fun” metric and create a truly impactful hackathon:

1. **Define Clear Themes (But Keep it Open-Ended):** Don’t just say "build anything you want." Instead, propose broad themes aligned with business objectives. Examples: "Improve the Developer Experience," "Explore New UI/UX Paradigms," "Solve a Key Customer Pain Point." The theme provides direction without stifling creativity.
2. **Provide Resources & Support:** This isn’t a “do it on your own time” event. Provide access to necessary APIs, documentation, and mentorship. Designate experienced engineers to act as “office hours” mentors.
3. **Focus on *Working* Prototypes:** The goal isn't a polished product; it's a functional prototype that demonstrates a viable idea. Encourage participants to focus on core functionality and avoid getting bogged down in perfection.
4. **Demo & Showcase (and *Follow Up*):** The demo day is crucial. Provide a platform for teams to showcase their work to a wider audience, including stakeholders. But don't let it end there! The real value comes from following up on promising projects. Allocate resources to further develop viable prototypes, integrate them into existing systems, or incorporate the learnings into future product development. Failing to follow up on promising projects can diminish the impact of the event and potentially discourage future participation.
5. **Celebrate *Effort* as Well as Success:** Not every hack will be a game-changer. Recognize and reward teams for their effort, creativity, and willingness to experiment, even if their project doesn't result in a groundbreaking solution.

**Addressing Potential Challenges**

It’s important to acknowledge that hackathons aren’t without their challenges. Engineers require dedicated time, which can impact ongoing projects. There’s also a risk of scope creep, where teams attempt too much and deliver incomplete prototypes. Furthermore, it’s crucial to have a clear process for evaluating and prioritizing projects after the event to avoid a backlog of unfinished work. By proactively addressing these challenges, you can maximize the benefits of your hackathon and ensure a positive experience for all participants.

**Take the First Step**

Hackathons, when approached strategically, are far more than just a fun team-building activity. They’re a powerful tool for fostering innovation, developing skills, and building a stronger, more engaged engineering team. Take the first step today by brainstorming potential hackathon themes aligned with your team’s key objectives. With strategic planning, hackathons can deliver significant value, and a relaxed atmosphere remains a valuable component of the experience.
