# Core Values Definition

For two decades, I’ve seen teams adopt core values like “Innovation,” “Customer Focus,” and “Collaboration” only to have them plastered on walls and… largely ignored. They become empty slogans, a box ticked on an HR checklist. The truth is, defining core values isn’t about creating a pretty list; it’s about consciously shaping the behavior *within* your engineering team. It’s about explicitly stating what you *reward* and *discourage*, and building a culture that reflects those principles. 

This isn't about following the latest management fad. It’s about foundational principles, and in my experience, good ones often bubble up *from* the team, not down *to* them. Here's how to define core values that aren’t just words on a wall, but actively guide your team’s actions.

**What you’ll learn:**

*   A practical approach to uncovering your team’s *existing* values.
*   How to translate abstract values into concrete, observable behaviors.
*   Strategies for reinforcing values through leadership, recognition, and accountability.

## The Problem with Generic Values

Let's be honest: "Innovation," "Integrity," and "Respect" are…fine. But they're so broad they're meaningless. Every company *says* they value these things. What does “Innovation” actually *look like* in *your* team? Is it encouraging experimentation, even if it leads to failure? Is it dedicating time to "spike" solutions? Or is it simply expecting people to magically come up with brilliant ideas while buried under deadlines? 

The key is specificity. Instead of "Collaboration," consider something like "Radical Transparency – We openly share information, even when it's uncomfortable." That’s a behavior you can observe and reinforce. 

## A Bottom-Up Approach: Uncovering Existing Values

I’ve found the most effective way to define core values is to start by understanding what the team *already* values. Forget brainstorming “ideal” values; let’s look at what currently drives behavior. 

Here’s a simple exercise:

1. **Recall Successes & Failures:** Gather the team (a smaller, representative group is fine to start). Ask: "Think about a time we were *really* successful as a team. What behaviors contributed to that success? Conversely, what behaviors led to a failure or frustration?"
2. **Identify Patterns:** Look for recurring themes. Did people consistently go the extra mile to help each other? Was there a willingness to admit mistakes and learn from them? Did the team prioritize thoroughness over speed, or vice versa?
3. **Phrase as Declarations:** Turn these observed behaviors into concise, declarative statements. Instead of "We value good communication," you might end up with "We prioritize direct, honest feedback, even when it's difficult."

This bottom-up approach isn’t just feel-good; it creates buy-in. The team recognizes the values as their own, not something imposed from above.

## From Values to Behaviors: The "How" is Critical

Defining the values is only half the battle. You need to explicitly connect them to *behaviors*. This is where things get real.

Here’s a simple framework:

| **Core Value** | **What it Looks Like (Behaviors)** | **What it Doesn’t Look Like (Behaviors)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Radical Transparency** | Sharing design docs openly, proactively admitting mistakes in stand-up, constructively challenging assumptions. | Holding back critical information, blaming others for failures, avoiding difficult conversations. |
| **Ruthless Prioritization** | Focusing on the highest-impact features, saying "no" to low-priority requests, regularly re-evaluating priorities. | Trying to do everything at once, getting bogged down in details, being afraid to drop features. |
| **Continuous Learning** | Dedicate time for tech talks, encourage experimentation, proactively share knowledge. | Relying on outdated skills, resisting new technologies, hoarding information. |

**Visual Suggestion:** A table like the one above, prominently displayed (e.g., in a team wiki or shared document).

## Reinforcing Values: Leading by Example (and Addressing Violations)

Values aren’t worth much if they’re not consistently reinforced. This means:

* **Leading by Example:** As an engineering leader, you *must* embody the values in your own behavior. If you value transparency, be open about your own mistakes. If you value prioritization, demonstrate how you make tough decisions.
* **Recognition and Reward:** Publicly acknowledge and reward team members who demonstrate the values. This could be as simple as a shout-out in a team meeting or a more formal recognition program.
* **Addressing Violations:** This is the hardest part. When someone acts in a way that violates the values, you need to address it directly. This doesn’t necessarily mean punishment, but it *does* mean having a conversation about how their behavior aligns (or doesn’t) with the team’s principles. Ignoring violations sends a clear message: the values don't actually matter.

I once had a team where a senior engineer consistently hoarded knowledge, refusing to document or share their expertise. It was frustrating the entire team. I had a direct conversation with him, explaining how his behavior violated our value of "Knowledge Sharing" and how it impacted the team’s ability to deliver. It wasn’t a pleasant conversation, but it was necessary.

## Beyond Buzzwords: Cultivating a Conscious Culture

Defining core values isn’t a one-time exercise. It’s an ongoing process of reflection, refinement, and reinforcement. Think of it as building a conscious culture – one where values are a fundamental part of how your team operates. 

It's about creating a space where people feel empowered to do their best work, knowing that their contributions are valued, and that the team is committed to a shared set of principles. And that, in my experience, is what truly separates high-performing teams from the rest. 

**Stop *talking* about values, and start *living* them.**  Consider scheduling a team workshop this week to uncover your existing values, or begin drafting the "What it looks like/doesn't look like" table for your team to get started.
