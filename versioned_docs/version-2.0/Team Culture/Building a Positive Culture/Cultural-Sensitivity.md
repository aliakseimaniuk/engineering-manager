# Cultural Sensitivity

For two decades, I've built and led engineering teams – from scrappy startups to established tech giants. One lesson consistently rises to the surface: high-performing teams aren't built on homogenous thought, but on the *productive tension* created by diverse perspectives. And at the heart of leveraging that diversity lies cultural sensitivity – not as a “nice to have,” but as a critical engineering leadership competency.

It's a topic often relegated to HR training, presented as a list of “do’s and don’ts.” But genuine cultural sensitivity goes far beyond avoiding offense. It's about fostering an environment where differing worldviews *enhance* problem-solving, innovation, and team cohesion. It’s about recognizing that “culture” isn’t just national origin; it’s shaped by individual experiences, professional backgrounds, and even preferred communication styles.

**The Danger of Assuming Shared Context**

We engineers pride ourselves on precision. We obsess over edge cases and strive for unambiguous communication. Yet, we often fall into the trap of assuming a shared context – a shared set of assumptions, experiences, and ways of interpreting information. This is especially perilous in diverse teams. 

Consider a scenario: a project stalls because of miscommunication, or a potentially brilliant idea is dismissed because it challenges established norms. These situations often stem from differing assumptions that go unaddressed. A junior engineer, fresh out of a coding bootcamp, might approach a design discussion with different priorities and assumptions than a seasoned architect who’s seen multiple projects through to completion. Their "cultures" – their professional experiences – are vastly different. Similarly, an engineer who grew up in a culture prioritizing direct communication might perceive a colleague's indirect style as evasiveness, while the latter might see directness as aggressive. 

This isn’t about right or wrong; it’s about *difference*. And if we, as leaders, aren’t attuned to these differences, we risk misinterpretations, conflict, and ultimately, suboptimal solutions. As Yuval Noah Harari points out in *Sapiens*, collective fictions—the shared beliefs that bind cultures together—can conflict. Just as differing collective fictions create tension in society, differing assumptions about project priorities can derail engineering projects. Recognizing these conflicts within a team, rather than trying to smooth them over, is where true innovation lies.

**Beyond Avoiding Offense: Proactive Cultural Intelligence**

So, how do we move beyond simply avoiding offense and cultivate proactive cultural intelligence? Here’s a framework I’ve found helpful:

* **Self-Awareness:** Start with *yourself*. What are your own cultural biases and assumptions? What blind spots might you have? Honestly acknowledging these is the first step.
* **Active Listening (Truly):** Teams often talk *at* each other, not *with* each other, leading to misunderstandings and rework. This means going beyond hearing the words to understanding the *intent* and *underlying message*. Ask clarifying questions. Paraphrase to ensure understanding. Be comfortable with silence.
* **Perspective-Taking:** Actively try to see the problem from another person’s point of view. What experiences might be shaping their perspective? What are their priorities?
* **Embrace Discomfort:** Productive tension requires being comfortable with disagreement and ambiguity. Don't rush to consensus. Encourage dissenting opinions. 
* **Create Space for Voices:** Ensure everyone on the team has an opportunity to contribute. Be mindful of power dynamics and actively solicit input from those who might be quieter. This goes beyond simply fulfilling a requirement; it’s about genuinely valuing diverse perspectives.

**The Power of “Not Knowing”**

Jørgensen and Sjøberg’s work highlights the importance of *not* learning from experience – specifically, the danger of prematurely solidifying assumptions based on past successes. This can lead to teams overlooking innovative solutions that don't align with past successes. This connects directly to cultural sensitivity. Be open to the possibility that *your* way isn’t necessarily the best way. Encourage experimentation and learning from failures.

I've found that the most successful teams aren’t necessarily the ones with the smartest people, but the ones where people feel safe enough to admit what they *don’t* know and to ask for help. This vulnerability fosters collaboration and allows the team to leverage the collective intelligence of its members. 

**Leading with Empathy**

Ultimately, cultural sensitivity isn't a skill to be mastered, but a mindset to be cultivated. It requires empathy, humility, and a genuine curiosity about the perspectives of others. It’s about understanding that difference isn’t a deficit, but a source of strength. 

As a leader, cultivate an environment where people are encouraged to explore their interests, regardless of their perceived relevance. Trust your team's instincts and empower them to take risks. And remember, the most valuable lessons often come from embracing the uncomfortable tensions that arise when different cultures collide.

This week, try actively soliciting feedback from team members who typically remain quiet in meetings. What unconscious biases might be hindering your team’s innovation?
