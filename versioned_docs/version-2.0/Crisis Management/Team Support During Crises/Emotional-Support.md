# Emotional Support

We talk a *lot* about technical debt, postmortems, and root cause analysis when it comes to crisis management in engineering. And rightly so. Those are crucial. But I’ve learned over two decades leading engineering teams that a surprisingly powerful, often overlooked component of effective crisis response is *emotional support*. It’s not “soft skills,” it’s foundational to getting the best from your team when the pressure is on.

I vividly recall one incident where a critical system went down on a Friday evening. The team immediately jumped into firefighting mode, fueled by adrenaline and caffeine.  I focused solely on the technical issues, pushing for quick fixes. What I *didn't* do was check in on how everyone was *feeling*. The result? A prolonged incident, frayed nerves, and a team that felt depleted, not empowered. I realized then that addressing the *people* experiencing the crisis was just as critical as resolving the technical problem.

For years, I focused almost entirely on the technical aspects of getting through incidents. I thought keeping my head down and directing traffic was enough. But I slowly realized that a team running on fumes, fueled by anxiety and self-doubt, will *always* perform below its potential, even with the best technical plan. 

This isn’t about hand-holding. It's about recognizing that a crisis isn’t just a technical problem; it’s a human experience. And treating it as such unlocks resilience, accelerates problem-solving, and fosters a stronger, more cohesive team.

## Why Emotional Support Matters During a Crisis

Think about the typical crisis scenario. Systems are down, alarms are firing, stakeholders are anxious, and engineers are scrambling. This is inherently stressful. When stress levels spike, cognitive function *decreases*. People become less creative, less adaptable, and more prone to errors. They're less likely to share crucial information, fearing blame. 

Emotional support helps mitigate this. Here's how:

* **Reduce anxiety, improve focus:** Acknowledging stress frees mental bandwidth for problem-solving.
* **Encourage open communication:**  Feeling safe fosters transparency and allows for crucial information sharing.
* **Build trust & resilience:** Genuine care strengthens team bonds and creates a foundation for long-term success.
* **Prevent burnout:** Regularly acknowledging effort helps combat exhaustion, particularly during prolonged incidents.

## Practical Ways to Provide Emotional Support

So, what does emotional support *look* like in the heat of a crisis? It's not about becoming a therapist, but about conscious, intentional leadership.

* **Acknowledge the Stress:** Start by simply acknowledging the situation and its impact.  “This is a tough situation, and I know everyone is feeling the pressure.”  It sounds simple, but it's powerful.
* **Check-In Regularly (Beyond Status Updates):**  Ask how people are *doing*, not just what they're working on. “How are you holding up?”  “Is there anything blocking you, besides the technical issues?” A quick one-on-one check-in can make a huge difference.
* **Normalize Mistakes:**  Crises are breeding grounds for errors.  Instead of dwelling on blame, focus on learning and preventing future occurrences. “We’re all under pressure, and mistakes happen. Let’s focus on what we can learn from this.”
* **Express Appreciation:**  Specifically acknowledge the effort and dedication of the team. “I really appreciate everyone staying late to work through this.”  “Your quick thinking on that issue saved us a lot of time.”
* **Lead By Example: Be Vulnerable (Appropriately):** Sharing your own anxieties (within reason!) can help normalize vulnerability and create a more human connection.  "I'm also feeling the weight of this, but I'm confident we can get through it together."
* **Protect Your Team (From External Pressure):** Shield your team from unnecessary demands or criticism from stakeholders.  You can act as a buffer and manage expectations.

**Visual Aid Suggestion:** A simple "Team Well-being Check-in" framework. During a crisis, implement a quick, recurring check-in (5-10 minutes, either verbally or via a dedicated Slack channel) where each person shares a quick status on both the technical issue *and* their emotional state (e.g., "Feeling stressed but making progress," "Good, focused, and on track").



## Beyond the Immediate Crisis

Emotional support isn’t just a crisis-time tactic. It’s an ongoing practice. Fostering a culture of psychological safety—where team members feel comfortable taking risks, sharing ideas, and admitting mistakes—is vital for both crisis response and everyday innovation. 

* **Foster a Culture of Psychological Safety:**  Encourage open communication, vulnerability, and constructive feedback in everyday interactions.
* **Invest in Team Building:** Stronger relationships build trust and resilience.
* **Promote Work-Life Balance:**  Prevent burnout by encouraging healthy boundaries and prioritizing well-being. 

I've learned that as leaders, we often get caught up in the *what* of problem-solving. But the *who* – the people solving the problems – is just as important. When we prioritize their well-being, we unlock their potential, build stronger teams, and create a more sustainable path to success. 

And that, in the long run, is a far more valuable outcome than simply putting out fires.

**This week, make a conscious effort to check in with each member of your team – not just about their tasks, but about *how they're doing*.**  Small gestures of genuine care can have a profound impact on team morale, performance, and overall well-being.
