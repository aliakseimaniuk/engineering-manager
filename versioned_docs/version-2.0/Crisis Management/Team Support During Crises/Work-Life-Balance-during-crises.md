# Work Life Balance During Crises

Crises – whether a global pandemic, a sudden market downturn, or an internal company upheaval – are unfortunately a part of the engineering leader's reality. We’re tasked with keeping projects on track, supporting our teams, and mitigating risk – all while navigating intense pressure and uncertainty. But what often gets lost in the scramble is *ourselves*. Maintaining work-life balance isn't a nice-to-have during a crisis; it’s a critical component of *managing* the crisis effectively. Because if *we* fall apart, our teams and projects will likely follow.

This isn’t about fluffy self-care tips. It’s about pragmatic strategies for engineering leaders to sustain themselves and their teams through periods of high stress and change. Over two decades of experience have shown me how neglecting this balance accelerates burnout, erodes decision-making, and ultimately hinders our ability to lead. Recent studies indicate that engineering leaders are particularly susceptible to burnout, with over 60% reporting feelings of chronic stress during periods of significant change.

## The Illusion of "Always On"

The current culture often glorifies being "always on." During a crisis, this pressure intensifies. We feel compelled to demonstrate commitment by working longer hours, responding to every ping immediately, and being perpetually available. However, this is a dangerous illusion. It's a recipe for rapid depletion of energy, diminished cognitive function, and ultimately, poor leadership.

I remember vividly the early days of the 2008 financial crisis. I was leading a small team building a critical piece of infrastructure for a fintech startup. The pressure was immense. I fell into the trap of working 16-hour days, fueled by coffee and anxiety. I thought I was being a good leader by “showing them how it’s done.” Instead, I became increasingly irritable, made several poor technical decisions, and nearly crashed a critical deployment. My team, sensing my unraveling, started disengaging. It took a frank conversation with a mentor to realize I wasn't *helping*; I was actively making things worse.

## The "Focus-Relax" Cycle & Systemic Failure

In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, I realized the importance of intentionally building in periods of recovery. Our brains and bodies aren't designed for sustained periods of intense focus without adequate recovery. Leadership coach Laura Berger notes that consistent overwork diminishes cognitive capacity and long-term performance. Think of it like a muscle: it needs rest to rebuild and become stronger. When we constantly push ourselves without allowing for rejuvenation, we reach a breaking point. 

What’s more, consistently exceeding individual and team capacity isn't just a personal problem; it creates systemic failure. As Laura points out, if roles aren’t adequately defined or there aren’t enough people to fill them, the burden falls on those who remain. This leads to bottlenecks, increased errors, and ultimately, project delays.

## Practical Strategies for Engineering Leaders

So, what can we do *practically* to maintain work-life balance during a crisis? Here are a few strategies that have worked for me and my teams:

* **Lead by Example:** This is paramount. If you’re sending emails at 11 PM, expect your team to feel pressured to do the same. Set clear boundaries for your own working hours and communicate them. Take your vacation time. *Really* take it.
* **Ruthless Prioritization:** Crises often bring a deluge of tasks. Identify the *absolutely* essential work and defer everything else. Don’t fall into the trap of “everything is a priority.” Effective prioritization allows you to focus on what truly matters, preventing overwhelm and ensuring resources are allocated efficiently.
* **Empower Your Team:** Delegate effectively. Trust your team to make decisions and handle tasks independently. Micromanaging will only add to your burden and stifle their growth.
* **Scheduled Disconnect Time:** Block out specific times each day where you completely disconnect from work – no emails, no Slack, no meetings. Use this time for activities that recharge you, whether it’s exercise, spending time with family, or pursuing a hobby.
* **Regular Check-ins (Beyond Project Status):** Make time for one-on-ones with your team members that go beyond project updates. Ask how they’re *really* doing. Listen actively. Offer support. Recognize their efforts.
* **Normalize Asking for Help:** Create a culture where it's okay to ask for help, both personally and professionally. Share your own vulnerabilities. This fosters trust and encourages team members to support each other.

## Beyond Survival: Building Resilience

Maintaining work-life balance during a crisis isn’t just about *surviving* the immediate challenges. It’s about building *resilience* – the ability to bounce back from adversity and thrive in the face of uncertainty. When we prioritize our well-being and the well-being of our teams, we create a more sustainable and effective organization. 

As leaders, we must remember that our teams are looking to us for guidance, not just during times of stability, but especially during times of crisis. By modeling healthy work-life balance, we not only protect ourselves but also empower our teams to navigate challenges with greater resilience and achieve lasting success.
