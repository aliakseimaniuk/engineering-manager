# Maintaining Morale

I recently spoke with an engineering manager, Sarah, who described a team paralyzed by process. Every change, even minor ones, required layers of approval, stifling innovation and draining morale. They weren’t burned out from *working hard*; they were stuck, feeling powerless to improve their situation. This is increasingly common, and a stark reminder that traditional morale boosters – team lunches, happy hours – fall flat when the core issue is a lack of agency.

As an engineering leader for over two decades, I’ve seen this pattern repeat. Teams grind down not because of *what* they’re doing, but because they feel powerless to change *how* they’re doing it. This isn’t a crisis of enthusiasm; it’s a crisis of agency. And restoring that agency isn’t just good for your team; it benefits *you* by fostering a more proactive, engaged, and ultimately less frustrating work environment. Here’s how to address it, going beyond superficial boosts and focusing on genuine, sustainable solutions.

## The Problem with "Perpetual Stuckness"

We often talk about burnout, and that’s real. But “stuckness” is subtly different. It’s a lack of control over one's work, a feeling of being a cog in a machine with no ability to influence the design or even the speed. It manifests as:

* **Quiet Disengagement:** People show up, do the work, but contribute little beyond the minimum.
* **Increased Friction:** Small issues become major roadblocks as people feel less invested in finding collaborative solutions.
* **Innovation Stifled:** The willingness to experiment or suggest improvements evaporates.
* **Passive-Aggression:** Complaints surface indirectly, or are expressed through subtle resistance.

These symptoms aren't just about unhappiness; they're indicators of systemic issues. And treating them with superficial rewards is like putting a band-aid on a broken leg.

## Shifting the Focus: From Motivation to Agency

Traditional motivational tactics assume a fundamental ability to *choose* to be more engaged. But when someone feels trapped within a rigid job description, that choice isn’t realistic. The key is to shift from trying to *motivate* people to *restore their agency*. This requires a deliberate, multi-faceted approach:

1. **Radical Transparency (and Listening):** This isn't about sharing every company secret. It's about being honest about the *why* behind constraints. Why are people limited in their roles? Is it budget, technical debt, legacy systems, or something else? *And crucially, listen to the solutions your team proposes*. Don't just nod and smile; actively explore feasibility. I once inherited a team deeply frustrated by a cumbersome deployment process. Instead of dismissing their complaints, I facilitated a two-week "innovation sprint" where they were given dedicated time to explore alternative solutions. It wasn’t a perfect fix, but it demonstrated genuine care and drastically improved morale.

2. **Micro-Negotiations & Role Flexibility:** Can you carve out small areas of responsibility where individuals can exercise more control? Maybe someone passionate about testing can take the lead on automating a key process. Perhaps someone skilled in documentation can mentor others. These small “wins” build confidence and a sense of ownership. Don't be afraid to bend the rules *within reason*. I've often found that a little flexibility in role definitions leads to a more productive and engaged team.  For example, allowing a developer to spend 20% of their time contributing to an open-source project related to their work can significantly boost their skills and motivation.

3. **Focus on Skill Development:** Even within constraints, there's room for growth. Invest in training that helps people hone their existing skills or learn new ones *relevant to their current roles*. Skill development doesn't *always* require expensive courses; internal knowledge sharing sessions, mentorship programs, or simply providing time for self-directed learning can make a big difference.

4. **Team-Level Retrospectives (and Actionable Outcomes):** Retrospectives aren't just about identifying what went wrong. They’re about identifying *what the team can change*. Don't just talk about problems; create a clear action plan with assigned owners and deadlines. Crucially, ensure those actions are implemented. I’ve seen teams get stuck in a perpetual cycle of retrospectives without ever seeing meaningful change. That’s worse than having no retrospectives at all.  *Also*, consider incorporating *organizational* retrospectives – expanding the scope to identify systemic issues hindering multiple teams.  These can reveal patterns and roadblocks impacting broader areas of the organization.

5. **Recognize and Address Overload:** Your team might not be bored, they might be *overwhelmed*. Insufficient staffing or unrealistic expectations lead to burnout *and* a loss of agency. If a team member is consistently taking on more than their fair share, address it directly. This isn’t about blaming individuals; it’s about identifying systemic imbalances and finding solutions.



## The Importance of "Genuine Care"

It’s easy to get caught up in metrics, deadlines, and deliverables. But ultimately, people are what drive success. When they feel valued, respected, and empowered, they’re more likely to be engaged, productive, and innovative.

I remember a factory in the 80s, a cautionary tale. Management ignored worker complaints about unsafe conditions and lack of input, leading to resentment, declining quality, and ultimately, significant financial losses. The lesson is clear: ignoring the voices of your team, however small, is a recipe for disaster.

## Avoiding a Dismal View & Taking Action

Not every problem can be solved overnight. But by focusing on restoring agency, fostering genuine care, and consistently acting on feedback, you can create a more engaged, resilient, and ultimately, successful team—even in the face of ongoing challenges.

So, here’s a challenge: **identify one constraint limiting your team’s agency this week, and brainstorm at least three potential solutions with your team.**  Even small steps can make a significant difference. 

Don't fall into the trap of treating symptoms with band-aids. Focus on restoring control and empowering your team to shape their work. That's a view worth striving for.
