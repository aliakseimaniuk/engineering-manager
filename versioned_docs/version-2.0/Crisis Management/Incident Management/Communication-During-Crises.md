# Communication During Crises

Crises happen. It’s not a matter of *if*, but *when*. As engineering leaders, we’re often focused on building robust systems to *prevent* failures. But a truly prepared leader also anticipates the inevitable – and prepares for how to communicate *during* those failures. It’s not just about technical recovery; it's about navigating the human element amidst chaos. I've seen this play out firsthand, from rapid-response bug fixes impacting thousands of users, to navigating the early days of the pandemic and its impact on team productivity and wellbeing. Here’s what I’ve learned about effective communication during crises, moving beyond the typical “fire drill” response.

**The Problem with Most Crisis Communication**

Too often, crisis communication defaults to a broadcast mode: a flurry of alerts, status updates, and vaguely reassuring messages. Think of the initial hours after a major outage. We focus on *what* happened and *what* we’re doing to fix it, but often neglect *how* people are feeling – both our teams, and our users. This feels…hollow. It reminds me of situations where concerns voiced by individuals are met with polite acknowledgements but little substantive action. It’s performative empathy, and it erodes trust.

The core issue is that most crisis communication treats people like individuals rather than *humans* experiencing stress, uncertainty, and potentially real impact. This is a fundamental leadership failure.

**Shifting the Paradigm: Four Principles of Crisis Communication**

Here’s how to move beyond broadcast mode and foster genuine, effective communication during a crisis:

**1. Transparency with Prudence:** People crave honesty, especially during tough times. Don’t sugarcoat the situation. Acknowledge the impact, the uncertainty, and what you *don’t* know. This doesn't mean sharing confidential details that could exacerbate the situation or compromise security. But sharing what *is* known, and acknowledging unknowns, builds credibility. 

* **Example:** Instead of "We're working on the issue," try "We've identified a critical database issue that's causing intermittent outages. We're working to restore service as quickly as possible, but we don't have an ETA yet. We'll provide an update within the next hour."

**2. Prioritize Two-Way Communication:** Communication shouldn't be a monologue. Create avenues for people to ask questions, voice concerns, and provide feedback. This can be as simple as a dedicated Slack channel, a recurring video call, or a designated point of contact. 

* **Actionable Tip:** In a crisis, resist the urge to *only* send updates. Actively solicit questions and respond thoughtfully. A simple, "What questions do you have right now?" can make a huge difference.

**3. Empathy and Acknowledgement:** Beyond acknowledging the technical issue, acknowledge the *human* impact. How is this affecting users? How is it impacting the team’s workload? Show genuine empathy for the stress and frustration people are experiencing.

* **Example:** "We know this outage is incredibly disruptive, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. We understand you rely on our service, and we're working around the clock to get things back to normal." For your team, acknowledge the extra hours and pressure.

**4. Consistent and Cadenced Updates:** Silence breeds anxiety. Even if you don't have a complete solution, provide regular updates – even if it’s just to say “We’re still working on it, and here’s what we’ve done so far.” A consistent cadence (e.g., every hour, every two hours) provides reassurance and demonstrates that progress is being made.

**Building Trust Through Honest Wins**

I’ve found inspiration in fields outside of tech. Thinking about negotiation and conflict resolution, the concept of “honest wins” resonates strongly. A truly successful outcome isn’t about “winning” at all costs; it’s about ensuring all parties feel satisfied and respected. This translates directly to crisis communication – building trust and rapport during challenging times. Acknowledge the pain points, be transparent about the challenges, and demonstrate a commitment to finding a solution that addresses everyone's needs.

**Empowering Teams with Organized Responsiveness**

Sometimes, a degree of organized responsiveness can be effective. Think of a rapid-response team – a flurry of activity, open communication, and a willingness to adapt on the fly. This isn't about abandoning structure, but about prioritizing speed and flexibility while maintaining transparency. The key is to empower teams to react quickly while keeping everyone informed, and ensuring consistent communication as outlined in the principles above.

**Final Thoughts**

Crises are inevitable. As engineering leaders, our responsibility isn’t just to *fix* the technical issues, but to navigate the human element with empathy, transparency, and a commitment to open communication. By shifting our focus from broadcast mode to genuine two-way communication, we can build trust, foster resilience, and emerge from crises stronger as teams and organizations.
